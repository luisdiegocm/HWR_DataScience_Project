Acute  Angle  Cloud  
Acute  Angle  Cloud  Overview  

Acute Angle Cloud is a globally distributed IaaS platform. It is designed to be a globally 
distributed cloud computing service with a basic-layer platform based on the New PC Network 
(distributed hardware terminals), the Acute Angle Chain and CAN (Content-Addressable Network). 
Its construction will be achieved though the Acute Angle Chain, Acute Angle Cloud 1.0 and Acute 
Angle Cloud 2.0. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

1.1: Figure: Overview of Acute Angle Cloud 
 

History  of  the  Internet  
On October 29, 1969, the first node of the University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA) was connected to 
the second node of the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) on the ARPANET, marking the inception of the 
Internet era. Looking back at the Internet’s history, from the very beginning to its current high-speed 
development, we can divide it, roughly, into three stages: Web1.0 Internet, Web2.0 mobile Internet and 
Web3.0 interplanetary Internet. 

The Web1.0 Internet began in the 1990s when the Internet was initially opened to the public. At 
that point, the technology needed for uploading information was incredibly expensive and had to be 
operated by professionals. Therefore, a large amount of online information was released and 
consumed by media firms, commercial institutions, schools and authorities. A vast reduction in cost 
and impressive increase in technological advancement has led to our current reality - almost every 
Internet user can upload information in various forms of content. Such a change has introduced the 
concept of Web2.0; mobile Internet. 

The Web2.0; mobile Internet is mainly manifested by users' participation or social interaction, 
the blog space, community websites, peer-to-peer tools, etc. While developing the Web2.0, the 
founder of the world wide web network, Tim Berners-Lee (along with other computer scientists) 
began to conceptualize Web3.0; interplanetary Internet. 

The original intention of Web3.0; interplanetary Internet was to facilitate communication using 
devices as terminals, rather than to communicate and aggregate information on the Internet, thus 
achieving "decentralization". Due to the development of the Internet and further progress in 
telecommunication, people can talk to almost anyone, from anywhere in the world. 



  

  

 

 

Blockchain,  A  New  Trend  
On October 31st, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper – “A Peer-to-Peer 

Electronic Cash System”, declaring the inception of the value transmission network. Bitcoin has many 
creditable designs such as data backup, relative anonymity of those involved, and, most importantly, 
a new system that eradicated the need for trusted third parties. However, its own transaction 
performance and Proof of Work (POW) consensus mechanism gradually revealed some problems. 

The underlying technology of Bitcoin is known as the blockchain. In recent years, people have 
innovated mainly concerning transaction performance, consensus algorithms and safe anonymity of 
the blockchain, such as promotion of transaction performance by graphene and the lightning network; 
enrichment and improvement of consensus algorithm by Proof of Stake (POS), Delegated Proof of 
Stake (DPOS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT); improvement of transaction safety 
by Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) and mixing. 

As a promising blockchain ecosystem, Acute Angle Cloud perfectly combines the strengths of 
Ethereum and BitShares and solves inherent defects of the existing blockchain system. Acute Angle 
Cloud is expected to gradually form a blockchain economy, promote industrial efficiency and boost 
efficient and synergetic development of society. It plans to accomplish this by the setup of a basic 
platform, exploitation of various products, and through the development and iteration of 
commercialized and implemented projects. Acute Angle Cloud defines a new blockchain economy. 

 

Acute  Angle  Cloud  Relevance  
1.   Prevention of resource waste 

Through virtual machines, the Acute Angle Cloud solves the issue of unused hard disk and CPU 
resources in the personal computer (PC). It can aggregate and allocate the users' idle hard disk and 
CPU resources with full cyclic use, forming an integrated application in a chain ecosystem. 

2.   Storage potential 
Through distributed storage technology, the issue of storage waste is solved. Data can be 

automatically re-distributed, enhancing the utilization rate of storage space and connecting all the 
computing devices with the same file system. The principle behind it is to replace address-based 
content with domain name content. In other words, users can find content saved in a location instead 
of an address and the hash of the content is verified instead of the identity of the content creator. It 
will enable webpage browsing to be faster, safer and more robust. 

3.   Cost Reduction 

Through blockchain technology, cloud computing, and CAN technology, the Acute Angle Cloud 
creates a distributed IaaS platform. It dramatically cuts the high operational and maintenance costs of 
traditional centralized server rooms and reasonably utilizes idle resources and shares the returns with 
its users. 

Strengths: low user cost, globalization, durable storage and high stability 

Acute Angle Cloud can be used as: 

•   A virtual machine’s root file system 

•   A server 

•   A database 

•   A (cryptographic) communication platform 



  

  

 

 

•   Any type of CDN 
•   A long-lasting Web 

Acute  Angle  Cloud  Development  plan  
Centralized  Cloud  Computing  Service  Model  Overview  

The structure of the cloud system has gained popularity in recent years, and it has unique 
advantages compared with conventional and locally deployed IT modes. The cloud service has won 
the favor of enterprises because of its many benefits, such as round-the-clock supported access, 
resource sharing, self-service, instant use on demand, pay-as-you-go, and can meet enterprises' needs 
of use in a flexible way so as to reduce the cost of use. As estimated by Gartner, an international 
research and advisory body, the global, public cloud services market has massive scalability, reaching 
US$209.2 billion in 2016. The figure is expected to hit US$246.8 billion in 2017 and exceed 
US$383.3 billion in 2020. 

 
 
 

4.1：Global Cloud Service Market Scale 
 

Even though cloud computing models are constantly evolving, the industry is currently divided into 
three major categories: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. The infrastructure is the first tier, the platform is the 
second tier, and software is the third tier, namely: 

 
•   IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) 
•   PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) 
•   SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) 

 
With the progression of the era we live in, cloud computing is no longer an option, but a 
requirement for enterprise development. To borrow a statement from Gartner, "Cloud is not a 
strategy, it is a tactic." (Cloud computing is no longer a strategic issue. It is a tactical issue.) 



  

  

 

 

 
 
 
 

Acute  Angle  Cloud  based  on  the  IaaS  Service  Model  
  

There are still two main problems associated with the current centralized cloud computing model: (1) 
Users do not own their own data; (2) Remote servers are susceptible to security breaches. Blockchain 
technology is separate to the centralized cloud computing model, and allows it to become 
decentralized. Bitcoin and other decentralized systems explicitly return digital assets to end-users, 
eliminating the need for a third-party server, or for trust in the infrastructure. IaaS, as the name 
implies, enables consumers to access services from a well-developed computer infrastructure over 
the Internet. 

 

 

The value of IaaS services in 2016 reached US$25.2 billion, with a growth rate of 56%, far more 
than 18% for the cloud service and 20% for SaaS. It's expected to maintain its rapid growth, with a 
compound annual growth rate of 29% expected by 2021. The development of IaaS infrastructure is 
relatively advanced, and the rapid distribution after its announcement has reached a considerable 
market size. 

 

Acute  Angle  Cloud  vs.  traditional  IaaS  platform  
  

The basic hardware of a computer is simple; It consists of computing components and storage 
components. The working process of the computer is just as conceptually basic; draw data from the 
storage component into the calculation component and compute. After the results are obtained, the 
output goes to the display and other devices and thus a cycle of work tasks is completed. The 
deployment of hardware terminals as global nodes is assisting the Acute Angle Cloud to gradually 
complete the transition from cloud to fog computing. 

2016 Cloud Service Market Shares 

4.2: Cloud Service Market Shares in 2016 



  

  

 

 

Fog computing is a paravirtualization frame model of service computing between cloud 
computing and personal computing. Fog computing focuses on small clouds such as Personal Clouds, 
Private Clouds and Enterprise Clouds, which operate differently from general cloud computing. Fog 
computing focuses on quantity which aids in its success, and every computing node plays a role, 
regardless of how weak its capacity is. Fog computing has several major features: low latency and 
location awareness, broader geographical distribution, applications suitable for mobility, and support 
for more fringe nodes. These features make deployment of mobile services more convenient, which 
can satisfy a broader connection of nodes. Cloud computing is a computing model which takes 
advantage of the Internet to use resources (such as storage devices of shared computing facilities and 
applications) anywhere at any time, conveniently and efficiently. Cloud computing consists of four 
basic parts: Cloud Platform, Cloud Storage, Cloud Terminal and Cloud Security. From the user's 
standpoint, it can be divided into Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud etc. From the service 
viewpoint, it can be divided into Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS) and 
Software as a service (SaaS). 

The main problems associated with the cloud computing industry are as follows: 
1.   Computing needs increase exponentially, and the cost of bandwidth remains high, 

leading to an increase of relevant operating costs. This becomes an obstacle for the 
development of a global industrial chain. 

2.   The cost of traditional CDN, self-built nodes is high and the node implementation is slow, 
which negatively effects users as computing needs increase. 

3.   Traditional cloud model's utilization of broadband is insufficient, resulting in a large 
number of wasted resources, which is also the main reason for the conflict between 
computing needs and computing power. 

Fog computing adds a layer between the terminal and the data center, known as the network 
edge layer. It's like adding another small server or router with a memory, that can process and save 
data without having to put it into the "Cloud" directly. This reduces stress on the Cloud and improves 
efficiency and transmission rates, while simultaneously reducing time delay. 

Compared with cloud computing, the framework adopted by fog computing is more distributed, 
and closer to the edge of the network. Fog computing concentrates information, data processing and 
data application on the devices at the edge of the network, rather than saving almost most of the info 
onto the cloud (as cloud computing does). The storage and processing of the data is more dependent 
on the local device, rather than the server. Therefore, cloud computing can be referred to as the new 
generation of centralized computing, whereas fog computing is the new generation of distributed 
computing which corresponds to the feature of "internet decentralization" and solves the problem that 
the cloud computing market currently faces. 

With P2SP technology, Acute Angle Cloud can provide shared computing services to the 
enterprises. The Acute Angle Cloud will incorporate blockchain technology to build a fair and 
transparent incentive mechanism, compelling members of the public to participate in the sharing and 
exchange of the data resources. Opening the shared computing services of the Acute Angle Cloud to 
individual users comprehensively makes each common user a resourceful node of the decentralized 
shared computing system, allowing them to benefit from it. 

Due to the cloud service’s beneficial features such as low cost, instant access, etc., the rapidly 
growing O2O, E-business, and social networking (to name a but a few) lead the way in realizing the 
benefits of transferring from the traditional self-built servers to cloud servers. Many surveys have 
shown an increase in the industries using cloud services. Cloud services are still at an early stage, but 
the settlement in security will result in more sectors migrating to the cloud. This crossover is expected 
to cover government administration, healthcare, finance, industry and other sectors in the next five 
years. 



  

  

 

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

4.4：Cloud Service Usage Trend for Different Industries 
 

According to a Global IaaS report issued by Gartner, Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and 
Alibaba Cloud are the top three cloud services in the world, with a market share of 44.2%, 7.1% and 
3% respectively. Amazon takes a dominating position, but Alibaba is the fastest growing 

The three major cloud service providers are actively developing their ecosystems. Amazon AWS 
is joining forces with other mainstream IT producers while Microsoft Azure is also supported on the 
OS Linux. Alibaba Cloud is taking advantage of the ecosystem which has already been built by 
Alibaba, potentially allowing a more seamless transition and user experience. Ecosystems have been 
a major force driving the growth of IaaS cloud services. 

 
 

Competition Analysis: 

1.   The cloud services that are directly serving individual users remain immature. The Acute 
Angle Cloud allows everyone to be at a crucial point of the distributed cloud network and 
builds an ecosystem based on the users, giving it both a competitive edge and commercial 
value. 

2.   The concern for security and privacy is still the greatest resistance for the adoption of a public 
chain. However, blockchain and CAN technology can solve the issues of data storage and user 
privacy. 

3.   The cost for centralized, physical storage can be reduced, but the cost in manpower, operations 
and maintenance remain difficult to curtail. In contrast, the distributed cloud storage does not 
need centralized servers, making the cost significantly lower. 

4.   The centralized servers can ensure data security, but not as well as CAN, which is capable of 
further reducing the system's redundancy, and ensures that the files are more secure through 
blockchain technology. 



  

  

 

 

 

Acute  Angle  Cloud  v1.0  
Overview  
The Acute Angle Cloud, v1.0, is based on the New PC Network (as the storage nodes) and the CAN 
peer-to-peer hypermedia distributed protocol to create a globally distributed file storage system. 
1.  Operational principle of the Acute Angle Cloud v1.0 

•   Each file and its block are given a unique “fingerprint”, called an encrypted hash. 
•   CAN deletes the files with the same hash value throughout the network, judges which files 

are redundant, and also traces the version history of each file. 

•   Each node stores the content that they want and the relevant index information, which helps 
locate the source. 

•   Files can easily be located using their hash value. 
•   Using IPNS (decentralized naming system), each file can be named with a readable name, 

instead of the hash, making it easy to find. What CAN envisions, is not only to turn all the 
network terminal nodes into a Browser or Client, but also to make anyone the operator of the 
network and storage server. 

 

2.  Characteristics of the Acute Angle Cloud 1.0 

•   The Acute Angle Cloud is based on content addresses, not the domain name address. Each 
file (content) is unique; one file connected to the CAN network would be given the only 
encrypted hash value based on its computing content. This would change our habit of utilizing 
domain names to access the network. 

•   Supplies a "history version controller" (such as git) of the file, and stores the different versions 
of the stored file to multiple nodes. 

•   The Acute Angle Chain operating on the CAN network is just the hash value table used for 
storing the internet files. The content (file) address on the link will be queried while accessing 
the network every time it is necessary. 

•   Uses the ecosystem’s reward distribution to encourage the user to contribute more shared 
space for storing data. The users obtain the ecosystem’s rewards by providing available disk 
space, processing power and bandwidth to the network. The users can exchange the rewards 
for storage space and other services within the ecosystem. 

 
•   The Acute Angle Cloud’s reward system allows a lower cost of data storage to the user, and 

the storage network is made more stable by setting online time goals to motivate users to stay 
online. 

•   The Acute Angle Cloud v1.0 helps build a freer and more independent network. 



  

  

 

 

 
Phased  upgrading  of  the  Acute  Angle  Cloud,  v2.0  
1.  Problems  solved  by  the  Acute  Angle  Cloud,  v2.0  

Acute Angle Cloud, v2.0 is committed to adopting a reward mechanism, through the 
establishment of a New PC Network, to distribute the Acute Angle Cloud’s nodes worldwide and 
create a unified IaaS service. This aims to realize economic globalization of the distributed cloud 
storage, as well as providing server services, CDN accelerated services, file storage services and 
database services for individuals or SMEs at a low storage price. 

 

2.  Operational  principle  of  the  Acute  Angle  Cloud,  v2.0  
To create a globally distributed IaaS service platform through networking, virtualization, 

operating systems, a New PC Network, OpenStack and the Acute Angle Cloud, v1.0. 

•   Computing: 

A set of controllers will be used in the management of the virtual machines for the life cycle of 
a single user or group, and will supply virtual services according to users' needs. They are responsible 
for the operation of the virtual machine including set up, startup, shutdown, standby, stop, adjust, 
remove, restart, destroy, and configuring CPU, internal memory and other information specifications. 

•   Object Storage: 

Swift refers to the system that creates object storage on a large scale of extensible systems 
through built-in redundancy and high error tolerance mechanisms, allowing for storing or retrieving 
files. It can provide image storage for the Glance, and volume backup service for the Cinder. 

•   Persistent Object Storage: 

The Acute Angle Cloud, v1.0 could incorporate object storage with the advantages of high error 
tolerance, higher security etc. on content-addressable and peer-to-peer hypermedia protocols. It also 
provides image memory for the Glance, and volume backup service for Cinder. 

•   Image Service: 
The search and retrieval system of virtual machine imagery supports multiple virtual machine 

image formats (AKI, AMI, ARI, ISO, QCOW2, Raw, VDI, VHD, VMDK). Uploading, deleting and 
editing the images basic information will be supported. 

•   Identity Service 
 Keystone. with the functions of providing identity verification, service regulations and service 
tickets for other services of OpenStack, manages Domains, Projects, Users, Groups and Roles. 

•   Network & Address Management: 
Supply network virtualization technology for cloud computing, and providing network 

connection services for other OpenStack services. The technology will supply the users with an 
interface, and will define: Network, Subnet and Router, configure DHCP, DNS, LB, L3 service, and 
the network supports GRE and VLAN. Plug-in architecture supports many mainstream network 
manufacturers and technologies, such as Open vSwitch. 

 

 



  

  

 

 

•   Block Storage: 

Provide a stable data block storage service for the cloud, and its plug-in driver architecture is 
available for the set up and management of block devices, such as set up volume, delete volume, on- 
hook and unload volume on the case. 

•   Lasting Block Storage 

Acute Angle Cloud v1.0 provides stable and persistent data block storage services on the cloud 
when it is running 

•   UI Dashboard 
A web management portal is used to simplify the service operations for the user, such as start- 

up, distribute IP addresses, configure access control, etc. 

•   Metering 
Filters almost everything that happens inside the Acute Angle Cloud v2.0, and provides data 

support for billing and monitoring, as well as other services. 

•   Orchestration 
A collaborative deployment method defined by a module is provided to achieve automatic 

deployment under the operation environment of cloud infrastructure software (computing, storage 
and network resources). 

•   Database service 
It provides extensible and reliable, relational and non-relational database engine services for 

users of the Acute Angle Cloud v2.0. 
 

Acute  Angle  Cloud  Global  Node  Distribution  Strategy  
Super  Network  Plan  Overview  
  

In order to speed up the deployment of the Acute Angle Cloud’s global resource nodes and 
improve the efficiency of point-to-point, end-to-end data transmission on the chain, the Super 
Network project emerged as a stand-alone application. It's based on the Acute Angle Chain and 
developed in the Acute Angle client, dedicated to serving the world. Blockchain believers and 
enthusiasts can invite more users to easily join in. Both new and existing users can concurrently build 
a blockchain-node network architecture that covers a wider area and more densely-distributed 
network, finally realizing a self-healing cloud computing storage network. 

In addition, in order to reach a consensus with the Acute Angle Cloud early adopters, we 
conducted a user survey (110 samples), before the Super Network plan was officially launched. The 
following are some of the findings: 



  

  

 

 

Do you support the creation of the Super Network? 
A: Heavily Support 
B: Support 
C: Do not support 
D: Indifferent 

 
What do you believe SN’s purpose to be? 
A: Necessary for accelerating the deployment of 
global nodes, making the ecosystem more powerful 
and stable 
B: Necessary, but there needs to be a balance 
between it and the Acute Angle Series 
C: I am against having SN 
D: Indifferent 

 
The more point-to-point nodes there are in the network, the faster the data transmission will be. 

The Super Network plans to serve blockchain enthusiasts around the world with its low threshold, 
high participation, and easy-to-use interface. Super Network plans to follow the open, transparent, 
and tamper-proof features associated with blockchain technology, allowing more users to easily get 
involved. The SN (ecosystem’s generic Token) reward is distributed to the resource contributors 
through an additional incentive mechanism that can be used within the cloud’s ecosystem. The Super 
Network plan will inspire more users to enter the blockchain world. The Acute Angle series hardware 
products (along other PC equipment) will serve as New PC Network devices and jointly serve as 
resource nodes in the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem. Users with other PC devices, can not only 
participate in the construction of the Acute Angle Cloud’s ecosystem easily and receive the SN Token 
reward, but will also receive AAC rewards (10% of the total amount of AAC, coming out of the Acute 
Angle Foundation reserve). 

This will help Acute Angle Cloud build a blockchain network architecture with nodes that cover 
a wider geographical area and larger distances. It will also lay the foundation for the integration of 
the resources gathered by the Acute Angle Cloud, into a cloud computing storage network that anyone 
in the world can rely on. 

 
 
New  PC  Network  Overview  
  

The New PC Network is made up of global PC devices that make up the Super Network. To help 
collect a large amount of idle resources from computing devices, we will build a complete Acute 
Angle Cloud ecosystem and provide users with safer and more convenient data storage services. The 
New PC Network is open to all users who have PC devices but are not fully utilizing the hardware 
and computing resources in them, they can share these idle resources and get rewards in return. 

Users can activate the Super Network by installing the Acute Angle client and exchanging AAC 
for a certain amount of SN to purchase an activation code. The activation is bound to that single 
device, and the device becomes a node registered on the Acute Angle Chain. The New PC Network 
devices join the Acute Angle Cloud’s global node layout strategy in exchange for rewards. Thus, a 
complete blockchain, full-node network is created by linking blockchain users, assets, applications, 
etc., and the Acute Angle Cloud’s global node coverage is expanded, while accelerating the point-to- 
point data transmission efficiency. 

We call on more users around the world to use their PC devices, join the Super Network program 
and share the “dividends” brought about by blockchain technology innovation. After the Super 



  

  

 

 

Network application is successfully activated, the user can select the devices’ idle disk, test the 
network environment, as well as other operations to complete resource sharing and become a new 
node registered on the Acute Angle Chain. The joint construction of the Acute Angle Cloud’s 
ecosystem is rewarded with token rewards. 

 
New  PC  Network  Advantages  
  

•   Uses idle computer resources 
•   Low operating threshold 
•   Blockchain attributes 
•   Computes resource sharing 
•   Safe and transparent 
•   Token reward distribution 

 
Acute  Angle  Chain  
Overview  

The Acute Angle Chain is a decentralized public blockchain platform, used by developers to 
quickly, easily and safely distribute tokens, smart contracts and blockchain systems. The Acute Angle 
Chain is committed to building a blockchain network system of global information, which values 
interconnection and trust exchange. The philosophy and technological mission of the Acute Angle 
Chain is to build an unobstructed blockchain world. 

 

Background  and  Importance  
Blockchain is a decentralized network capable of achieving peer-to-peer value exchange, which 

is referred to as value Internet. Helped by Acute Angle Chain, we can create a decentralized and 
value-driven world of mutual cooperation and peer-to-peer exchange where an individual is directly 
connected to another as part of a community or society. 

First, we build a safe and stable modular blockchain network allowing us to use smart contracts 
and digital assets. At this stage, we introduce the Acute Angle PC - a hardware capable of intelligently 
testing, monitoring and running a suitable environment. The Acute Angle PC can ensure that contracts 
running in the Acute Angle Chain are safe, thus preventing events such as DAO. 

The Acute Angle Cloud can meet different industries’ storage needs, including insurance 
companies, electronic files, digital currency, trace origin, and personal credit record. The blockchain 
network is constantly evolving, easy to use, low cost and susceptible to customization. With the Acute 
Angle Chain, we connect user information and might even get through to other networks (possibly 
non-blockchain) for data interaction, thus building a cyberspace of multidimensional data correlation. 
Through multidimensional data such as personal credit, assets, production and consumption data, we 
can better integrate community consensus, individual behavior and value exchange. Carrying value 
in the ecosystem, the digital currency issued by the Acute Angle Chain and named after it as AAC. 
Using the AAC can allow us to share CDN services, idle hard disk resources, original resources and 
other basic blockchain services. 

 
 
 



  

  

 

 

Design  Philosophy  
The Acute Angle Chain puts stability, security, scalability and ease of use among its design 

priorities. By introducing modular virtual machines, value exchanges, and bifurcation mechanisms, 
we create a blockchain network that is easy to use, low-cost, and moderately customizable. In theory, 
the Acute Angle Chain can achieve 1,000 TPS of available performance by optimizing the block 
intervals, block capacity, and consensus algorithm. The New PC Network, which is one of the core 
parts of the Acute Angle Cloud, is a globally distributed, hardware terminal system that is aggregating 
all the hardware devices of individuals around the world and is designed based on the edge calculation 
technology of fog computing to build a web 3.0 interplanetary Internet. Everyone who uses a 
hardware device that is not saturated and has sufficient computing capabilities to join the Super 
Network program will become a resource node for the Acute Angle Cloud. With the development of 
its global nodes, the Acute Angle Cloud will increase its distributed cloud space and its capability to 
achieve a fully functional distributed cloud computing network system. We believe that through the 
adoption of blockchain technology, innovation will be able to solve the crisis of trust between people, 
and create new network relationships, to better integrate community consensus, individual behavior, 
and value exchange. 

 

1.  Stability 

Stability is necessary to ensure the existence of the Acute Angle Chain. The blockchain 
incorporates distributed features for intermediation, and the decommissioning of the network is 
usually complicated and uncertain. Therefore, we use block design tools to abstract and simplify the 
blockchain. By building a stack-type smart contract running WebAssembly (WASM) encoding format, 
we draw two main benefits. Firstly, it optimizes the performance of the virtual machine and directly 
improves the contract execution efficiency and reduces the interference caused by the system 
coupling. Secondly, it weakens the correlation between the blockchain network and the smart contract 
running status - even if the contract execution has problems, or the virtual machine runs abnormally, 
the block and chain’s network stability can still be guaranteed. 

 
2.  Safety 

Proof of Work (PoW) has contributed tremendously to the safety of the Bitcoin network. 
However, due to the increasing difficulty of computing, almost all the rights were concentrated in the 
miners and mining pools. Through professional cooperation, they have in fact become highly 
centralized "central servers." If their combination exceeds 51% of the computing power, it can 
theoretically control most Bitcoin transactions, such as the DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) 
attack we are familiar with. In addition, the high power consumption is equally plagued by criticism. 
The Proof of Stake (PoS) mode is still developing compared to PoW. These developments are mainly 
based on security and applications. The PoS model has a major advantage in terms of security over 
the PoW model, but the premise is to attract enough holders to fully get the advantages of that security. 
Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) is an improvement of PoS, and is equivalent to PoS in terms of 
security. Theoretically, it can improve block response and increase network stability and security. In 
addition, the Acute Angle Chain innovatively proposes a smart sandbox mechanism. Contracts issued 
by any person must first be tested in a smart sandbox. The Acute Angle Chain will conduct full-path, 
automated testing and continuously monitor its operational status. If the health level deteriorates, or 
if a flaw is found, the network will judge it at its own discretion and avoid problematic contracts that 
may cause damage to the blockchain ecosystem. 

 

3.  Extensibility 

Extensibility is put forward to solve the information island problem of incompatible blockchains. 
Firstly, we believe that upgrading and forking are effective approaches for network evolution, with a 



  

  

 

 

main chain and some sub chains taking shape after forking. Technically, main chain and sub chains 
are completely equivalent, but are arranged with different identifications on the basis of community 
consensus. Each sub chain may be customized for different commercial applications and Value 
Exchange Protocol (VEP) is constructed among sub chains, which works similar to a gateway and 
via which, sub chains can interact exchanging information and value. This can form a blockchain 
ecosystem of multiple applications. Furthermore, non-blockchain online data is incorporated into the 
Acute Angle Chain ecosystem, supplemented by smart contracts, to respond to events in the real 
world. 

 

4.  Usability 

Acute Angle Chain is a decentralized public blockchain platform. Developers can use the Acute 
Angle Chain to release Tokens, smart contracts and blockchain systems simply, quickly and safely. 
The Acute Angle Chain is committed to building a global blockchain network system that allows for 
the exchange of information, interconnects value and trust. The philosophy and technical mission of 
the Acute Angle Chain is to build a blockchain world without obstruction. 

  
Working  Principle  

Acute Angle Chain connects numerous forks via Value Exchange Protocol (VEP) and even gets 
through to other networks (maybe non-blockchain) to make data interaction to build a cyberspace of 
interconnection and multidimensional data correlation. 

 

1.  Contract creation and LVM 

Smart contract implementation 

Traditional smart contracts limit the input and output of data on the chain and can only support 
some simple application scenarios. The Acute Angle Chain, besides allowing for data on the chain, 
also allows for interaction with data on and off of the chain itself. It further supports the update of 
data on and off the chain simultaneously. It’s commercial applications in the real world are varied and 
very complex; this complexity is reflected in the data structure and the logic. A complete Turing 
programming language and virtual machine are needed to create and execute smart contracts. WASM 
(WebAssembly) is a portable, underlying bytecode technology whose stack-type virtual machines are 
custom-designed and optimized for a blockchain environment and can run smart contracts at speeds 
close to native machine code. The benefits of WASM lie in industry standardization and extensive 
support. Programmers can develop smart contracts in familiar languages such as C, C++, Golang, and 
Rust, greatly reducing the cost of learning and improving development efficiency. Therefore, the 
Acute Angle Chain selects WASM as the execution code of the smart contracts. 

The life cycle of a contract in a blockchain network can be divided into five stages: 

1) Select programming language and create source code; 

2)The compiler assembles the source code into WASM bytecodes; 3) 
The Smart Contract is registered with the Acute Angle Chain; 4) 
Request the contract to open API; 
5)Upgrade or destroy the contract; 



  

  

 

 

 
 

In the above life cycle, Tokens need to be consumed for registration, request, and upgrade of 
smart contracts. On the one hand, because the implementation of the contract must consume CPU, 
memory, hard disk and network bandwidth, the resource providers need to be rewarded. On the other 
hand, it also uses economics to raise the threshold of network attacks and thus reduce risks. 

The open APIs of smart contracts are shown to users as RESTful APIs. The contents of HTTP 
requests are encoded in JSON format. Users can generate and send requests through the browser or 
mobile phone APP. Acute Angle Chain's RESTful API plug-in receives and recognizes requests from 
a smart contract’s API, and if it is one, it passes the request to the middleware of the WASM virtual 
machine. The middleware translates the request content into the byte code of the WASM, then calls 
the corresponding API of the equivalent contract, and finally returns the result of the API execution 
to the user. The entire process is shown in Figure 2.1: 

 
 
 
 
 

 

2.  Consensus Mechanism 

Due its distributed nature, the blockchain needs a consensus mechanism that functions properly. 
Currently, widely used consensus algorithms mainly include: PoW (Proof of Work), PoS (Proof of 
Stake), PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) and DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake). From a 
safety and practicality standpoint, the Acute Angle Chain uses an improved DPoS consensus 

 



  

  

 

 

mechanism. Result-delegated Proof of Stake (R-DPoS) not only inherits the advantages of DPoS - no 
need to consume additional resources to distribute rewards – but it can also decide whether to validate 
the agent’s or the node’s smart contracts according to the network’s transaction status. 

 
 

The Token associated with the Acute Angle Chain can not only be traded for the blockchain basic 
services such as contract release and network bifurcation, but it also participates in voting and has 
the opportunity to become a proxy node and provide Token rewards. The Acute Angle Chain named 
this Token “AAC”. Each AAC holder is called an equity person and is allocated the corresponding 
voting weight based on the number of AACs held. The agent node is selected by the equity holder. 
The first 31 winners, agent nodes with the most votes, become deputy nodes, which in turn 
authenticate the transactions. The work order is determined by the number of votes. The agent node 
can accumulate rewards if it works normally. If it works abnormally or does not work, it will be 
punished. 

The election is conducted in real time and is unending. New users can participate in the voting 
process at any time, and users who have already voted can also withdraw their votes at any time or 
change them. Therefore, the elected agent node is not permanent, nor do they have a fixed term, 
and may be surpassed and replaced by others at any time. In addition, we have made some 
optimizations in the consensus algorithm to prevent the agent nodes from being fixed and avoid the 
network from gradually becoming centralized. 

 
3.  Account model 

In the blockchain network, the account address was designed to provide safety. The address 
creation follows the following steps: public key, private key as follows: private key—>public key—
>account address. All three items use the Secure Hash Algorithm (referred to as SHA), which can 
ensure safety. Hash is the extraction of information with less output than input and fixed length. The 
hash with strong encryption is irreversible. i.e., the private key information cannot be deduced by 
using the account address. The detailed generation process of the private key, public key and account 
is as follows: The creation of a private key, public key and account can be divided into two kinds of 
accounts based on the byte length of the account address, main account and sub-account. 

 

4.  Value Exchange Protocol(VEP) 

VEP refers to standard protocol between different blockchain networks. As mentioned above, 
the applications that can be loaded on a network are limited, but when different networks connect to 
form a larger network, this leads to an exponential increase in value. 

How do single network nodes trust other nodes at first? The biggest advantage of the blockchain 
network is to provide reliable information, and such reliability is embodied on the distributed account 
ledger and consensus. A blockchain network is a community that agree on a consensus – this develops 
a mutual trust relationship between nodes, which is needed for taking a blockchain network as the 
node and forming connections among several blockchain networks. 

VEP creates rules for cooperation. It registers the information of each chain and provides 
services to the chain in letter list for query and connection requests. VEP supports two kinds of 
application circumstances, cross node interaction and cross chain contract request. The former 
develops interaction between contracts indirectly by checking the status of data saved on the node or 
external data and tries to generate new information. 

For example: unpaid loans due in accordance with the contract will affect the individual credit. 
A loan record can be saved in the blockchain A, while the credit data can be saved in the blockchain 



  

  

 

 

B.  Individual identity information may come from an external public database. While the latter refers 
to mutual invocation between contracts. A simple case is that the total value is always constant after 
exchanging the Tokens of the two chains. 

 

Acute  Angle  Platform  Application  Scenarios  
Scenario - Supply chain finance: 

Supply chain finance refers to a financial service with the lowest risk that is controlled by 
information integration under financial institutions (generally refers to banks) managing capital flow 
and logistics of medium and small sized enterprises. Due to a large number of participants, different 
kinds of information are saved in each link, which means that commodity information of supplier is 
stored in the warehouse information of the supplier, shipment information is grasped by the logistics 
company, capital information is distributed in the bank system, and transfer information is grasped by 
core enterprise. Because of information asymmetry and non-transparency of information required by 
collaboration, the effective supply chain credit system is hard to be established. Due to high cost of 
credit establishment, the financial institution has to operate prudently responding to risk control. 
Thus, some high quality items are often missed. 

Acute Angle Platform is able to help enterprises and financial institutions to reconstruct the 
credit system and establish more efficient supply chain finance. Endorsing the core enterprise, the 
blockchain platform for warehouse, logistics, digital bill and enterprise credit can be developed 
through Acute Angle Chain, which can realize commodity, warehouse, logistic and accounts 
receivable commonly witnessed by the up and down stream enterprises and financial institutions on 
the supply chain. The issuance, approval, transfer, splitting and acceptance of digital bill shall be 
triggered by each participant of supply chain through contract, with trigger condition based on change 
of data status of warehouse, logistic blockchain and core enterprise database, and prepared by the 
contract of each participant. The behavior of compliance or violation of the rules will be ALL 
recorded in the credit blockchain, which cannot be tampered. 

 

Acute  Angle  Hardware  Series  
Overview  

The Acute Angle hardware series is one of the components of the New PC Network. It establishes 
a reward for users through smart contracts based on Content-Addressable Network (CAN) peer-to-peer 
hypermedia protocol storage, and Acute Angle Chain public chain digital asset management. These 
include all kinds of hardware devices from personal computers to mobile devices. Using content-
addressing technology, the hardware terminal that joins the New PC Network is used as a node to 
complete the network. 

CAN connects all computing devices under the same document system. CAN is like a bit stream 
group that can exchange objects at the same Git warehouse. In other words, CAN provides a content- 
addressable block storage model and content-addressable hyperlinks, creating a generalized Merkle 
Directed acyclic graph (DAG). In this data structure, we can establish an edition control system, 
blockchain, or even a permanent world-wide-web. CAN has combined distributed hash tables, block 
switching with an incentive mechanism and a self-authenticated name-space. CAN has no single point 
of failure, and there is no need for mutual trust between nodes. 



  

  

 

 

 

 
3.1  : Acute Angle PC I generation 

 

We named the first product of the Acute Angle hardware series, the Acute Angle PC. We designed 
both the Acute Angle PC I generation and II generation with triangular shapes in order to reflect the 
trust, stability, and firmness of the blockchain spirit. 

The Acute Angle PC I generation is a product based on the blockchain technology. It can use the 
distributed cloud storage, idle hard disk space, shared cloud computing and bandwidth (contributed 
by Acute Angle hardware series) to provide comprehensive and sustainable CDN services for Internet 
businesses. It is also capable of speeding up its service to meet the demand of a large number of 
innovative businesses such as download platforms, UGC acceleration platforms, online streaming 
platforms and dynamic acceleration platforms whilst also allocating the ecosystem's reward for those 
contributions. The customers with the first generation Acute Angle PC are considered founder nodes 
and get extra rewards. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

3.2  : Acute Angle PC II generation 
 

The Acute Angle PC II generation is the second PC from the Acute Angle hardware series and an 
upgrade from the first generation. We have built-in crypto chip technology in the Acute Angle PC II 
generation, providing users with double encryption to more safely protect their digital assets. It also 
has a new fingerprint identification and unlocking boot form, more in line with "identity 



  

  

 

 

identification”, which is particularly important in the blockchain era. More powerful performance 
and configuration upgrades will provide users with a better product experience. 

 

Hardware  Advantages  
  

1.   Blockchain technology empowers products 
The Acute Angle hardware series not only retains the hardware’s original features to bring users a 
familiar but fresh product experience, but also gives them blockchain attributes and distributed 
architecture, thus applying the blockchain technology to people's daily lives. The "blockchain +" 
model facilitates people learning and understanding of the technology. 

 
2.   Eco-friendly low-power design 

The Acute Angle hardware series adopts today's mainstream hardware configuration with even better 
performance leading to a better user experience. At the same time, however, priority is given to a 
configuration that has a lower energy consumption, ensuring the user, as a node of the Acute Angle 
Cloud’s ecosystem can be online all-day long, still taking advantage of safe and stable services, for 
energy consumption and getting more rewards. 

 
3.   Facilitating equipment maintenance 

The internal structure and configuration of each Acute Angle hardware series device is highly uniform 
at the time of shipment to ensure that all products are efficient, safe to operate and accurately respond 
to user’s needs. 

 

Application  Scenarios  
  

1.  Surfing the Internet and entertainment 

The Acute Angle PC I and II generations use Windows 10 and can be used to perform the same 
functions of an ordinary PC. 

 

2.  Sharing storage 
The Acute Angle PC I generation can provide users with a large, safe, reliable and low-cost CDN 

cloud storage service and provide data reliability. Users can save information on it, access the Internet 
and connect it to an external hard drive to expand its storage capacity and processing capability; 

 

3.  Reward System 

Based on the Acute Angle Chain's ecosystem, users can contribute with their own idle broadband, 
storage and computer capacity to obtain rewards. 

 
In the future, the Acute Angle Cloud will open more significant service capabilities and provide users 
on the cloud with CDN acceleration services that meet the needs of Internet businesses. Not only can 
users join the New PC Network to share computing resources such as idle CPU, hard disk space, and 
upstream bandwidth to get ecosystem rewards, but they can also easily gain community rewards 
through sharing content, gain both intellectual and material fulfillment and sharing the technological 



  

  

 

 

innovations’ dividends. 
 
Acute   Angle   Coin/AAC   and   Super   Network   Token/   SN  
Overview  
  
AAC  and  SN  Introduction  
  

With the development of the Acute Angle Cloud’s ecosystem stability, the applications in the 
ecosystem will gradually be used. This requires a constant value exchange process to meet users’ 
needs. The use of the application under the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem is not affected by 
fluctuations in the market value of digital assets, so the exchange of applications does not depend on 
price. Therefore, we will issue the value-based circulation medium Acute Angle Coin (AAC) based 
on the Acute Angle Chain and the ecosystem’s universal Token known as the Super Network Token 
(SN). 

 
AAC  introduction  
  

In order to ensure the smooth operation of the Acute Angle Cloud Platform and the needs of 
commercial applications, the Acute Angle Chain main network was based on Ethereum to release the 
Acute Angle Coin/AAC, with a total volume of 1 billion units. 

 
AAC is used as a valuable and exchangeable medium in the Acute Angle Cloud’s ecosystem. AAC 
will also be used as a digital asset for the Acute Angle Cloud. Users can take advantage of the AAC 
to exchange for SN and acquire storage space, content review, and application development among 
other series of interactions the application performs. 

 
AAC is based on the sharing economy of cloud computing technology and blockchain technology. 
Through smart contracts, smart regulations and reporting systems users are ensured that sharing 
computing resources and content awards them a reward equivalent, which cannot be denied or 
tampered with; through the decentralization of account records, we ensure that all transactions are 
true, open and transparent; we use the blockchain to register users' copyrights and modify records 
thus protecting them from infringement. 

 
We designed the first application scenario of the AAC as a universal token exchange method for all 
application services. It was also created as a medium for users to provide and exchange computer 
resources and to ensure the user's rights. Early participation is a big advantage due to the increase in 
difficulty of obtaining awards over time as the limited amount of AAC is distributed as competition 
grows. 

 
In addition, we will provide users with an array of community activities, encouraging more users to 
join, and deliver more data nodes and bandwidth, storage, computing power, and other resources for 
the shared computing ecosystem. The entire ecosystem has maintained a good cycle at the Customer 
end. 



  

  

 

 

SN  Introduction  
  

In order to ensure the availability of operational applications and the stability of application prices in 
the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem, we will issue a negotiable, equivalent interchangeable ecosystem 
"universal token" based on the Acute Angle Chain. It is named Super Network Token/SN. 

 
The value of each SN token will be anchored to the US dollar to set the price for all 
applications/functions in the ecosystem. When the user requests the use of a certain function, only a 
certain amount of AAC needs to be converted into SN (according to the conversion ratio at the time) 
to be allowed to use the application/function. 

 
Throughout the exchange process, point-to-point and end-to-end transaction data security is ensured 
through the use of encryption technology, distributed ledger technology, trusted cloud technology, 
and chip technology. 

 
 
 
 
AAC  and  SN  application  Scenarios  
  

In the entire Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem, AAC is used to complete the application conversion and 
SN is used to complete the application activation. AAC acts as a digital asset for users in the 
ecosystem, and the SN acts as a generic token consumed for activating applications/functions or 
exchanging resources. The application scenarios of AAC and SN are as follows: 

 
AAC  application  scenarios  
  

Cloud storage service 

The token can be exchanged for cloud storage space based on the users' needs. 
 

Shared Cloud computing service 

The token can be exchanged for safe and stable Cloud computing services, as well as for a large scale 
of distributed underlying structure and a decentralized and specialist Cloud encryption technology 
service. 

 
Shared CDN service 

Based on a high quality network infrastructure and Cloud computing technology, low-cost and 
extensible Internet content distribution services with high performance. 
As the shared economic of Cloud computing and blockchain technology developers, the AAC will 
have more application scenarios, including: 

 

Shared content services 

Users can acquire AAC through the Acute Angle PC reward system or by participating in official 
activities/events, e.g. by advertising different unique content published by other users on the content 
sharing platform. 



  

  

 

 

 
 

Open platform for Acute Angle applications 

Applications developed on the platform can be purchased using AAC. 
 

SN  application  scenarios  
  

Acute Angle client SN application activation 
 

The first time the user turns on the Super Network application, it requires a certain amount of AAC 
to be exchanged for SN. Once the exchange is complete, the user can then activate the Super Network 
application. 

 
Acute Angle Cloud Application Exchange 

 
After the creation of the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem platform, the SN can be used in exchange for 
services and applications on the platform. 

 

Trading on the Acute Angle trading platform 
 

When the SN reaches a stable stage of development, the Acute Angle trading platform will be 
launched as a ratio exchange between the designated currency trading pair of the platform and other 
digital currencies. 

 

"Super Network Node" election vote 

As the number of nodes in the global layout of the Acute Angle Cloud expands and in order to protect 
fairness and improve the operational efficiency of the network’s decentralization, we will adopt a 
Super Network proxy voting campaign and use the SN to vote on Super Network Nodes and conduct 
dynamic elections. Any node can participate in the election, as long as the number of votes can catch 
up, it will replace the original Super Network proxy. 

 

Create a public chain service based on the Acute Angle Chain 

Users can create a public chain based on the Acute Angle Chain by using SNs, facilitating the 
threshold to develop, shorten the development time of public chain-linked projects and save on costs. 

 

With the establishment and gradual improvement of the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem, SN will be 
applied to more scenarios. 

 
 

AAC  and  SN’s  distribution  plan  
With the development and maturity of the Acute Angle Cloud, it will gradually support a value 

service system using AAC as its medium of circulation and SN as its universal token. Both AAC and 
SN will be used to implement applications including activation, replacement of storage space, content 
sharing, application development, etc., calculating and recharging exchange functions. 



  

  

 

 

 

AAC  Distribution  plan  
  

When the user participates in an activity initiated on the platform, the smart contract attributed to that 
activity will automatically generate AAC. Initially, the total amount of AAC will be 1 billion units. 
The percentage allocated for users’ rewards is 45%, fully protecting users and creating a strong market 
atmosphere. In order to ensure the prosperity of the Acute Angle community, maintain its healthy 
development, and invest in the construction of application platforms, the remaining AAC will be 
retained by the foundation, founding team, and cornerstone investors. The specific distribution of 
AAC is as follows: 

 

Reward System: 45% 

45% of the total issuing amount will be given to the users as a reward for using the Acute Angle 
hardware series reward system. The AAC will be distributed as an incentive to share resources up to 
a maximum of 450 million AAC. 

 

Project Foundation Reserve: 25% 

25% of the total issuing amount will be kept by the Foundation as a reserve, which will be used to 
support the technological development of subsequent projects, community operations, business 
cooperation, publicity expenses and project maintenance. The Board of Directors will decide the 
expenditure of the reserve at their own discretion, and make an announcement prior to using this 
reserve. 

 

Cornerstone investors: 25% 

25% of the total issuing amount will be given to early private investors in order to kick start the project, 
build the team, platform operations and other aspects. There will be a lock up period for private sale 
investors. 50% will be locked when issued, and unlocked when the token is online and available for 
trading; 25% will be unlocked 3 months after the token starts being traded online, and the remaining 
25% will be unlocked 6 months after the token starts being traded online. 

 

Initial team and R&D team: 5% 

5% of the total issuing amount is given to the initial team and R&D team as a reward. The reward 
will be unlocked one month after the token starts, opening online at the rate of 0.25% a month for a

SN  Distribution  Plan  
  

In order to set the price of the applications in the Acute Angle Cloud ecosystem, the Acute Angle 
Chain main chain is based on SN, (the Super Network Token) which is issued by Ethereum, and used 
as the exchange medium for applications (1SN=1 dollar). The SN, as an incentive that runs on the 
Super Network, will be first issued with 1 billion units. The specific distribution of SN is as follows: 

 
 

Reward System: 45% 

45% of initial issuing amount will be given to the users as a reward for using the Super Network 
reward system. The SN rewards have a limit of 450 million SN. 
Project Foundation Reserve: 40% 

40% of the initial issuing amount will be kept by the Foundation as a reserve, which will be used to 
support technological development of subsequent projects, community operations, business 
cooperation, publicity expenses and project maintenance. The Board of Directors needs to decide and 
make an announcement when using this reserve. 

 

Cornerstone investors: 5% 

5% of the initial SN issued amount is used to attract early investors. Early investors will contribute 
to the SN's team building and platform operations. The release will be locked initially and will start 
unlocking in the 4th month and every subsequent month thereafter. Cornerstone investors will have 
10% of the total pool unlocked monthly, and it will be completed in 10 months. 

Initial team and R&D team: 10% 

10% of the initial issuing amount is given to the initial team and R&D team as a reward. The reward 
will be unlocked one month after the token starts being traded online at the rate of 0.5% of the initial 
amount a month for 20 months. 



  

  

 

 

 

 
 

5.3: Distribution Plan 
 

Note: Refer to AAC's operating mechanism for detailed SN generation algorithm 
 
Methods  of  acquiring  AAC  and  SN  
  

The AAC is generated through shared Acute Angle hardware resources such as hard drive speed, 
upstream bandwidth, CPU computing ability and other ecosystem reward mechanisms. It is mutually 
decided by combining the Acute Angle Chain's interactive behavior in specific block cycles. 

•   Users can purchase the Acute Angle hardware devices, and activate the Acute Angle Coin's 
reward plan to get the AAC by sharing resources; 

•   Users can contribute with upstream bandwidth, available hard drive space, CPU computing 
power, hard disk speed, and/or a multi-dimensional scoring algorithm according to the 
equipment stability in order to be rewarded with AAC; 

•   Users can also participate in Acute Angle Cloud official activities and acquire AAC according 
to the activity’s rules. 

•  Acute Angle hardware users in the New PC Network can also receive the Acute Angle 
Cloud’s ecosystem reward. 

How  to  get  SN  rewards.  
  

New PC Network devices 
 

Users that are part of the New PC Network (including the Acute Angle hardware series and 
other PCs) can download and install the Acute Angle client, use a certain number of AAC to 
redeem the activation code and activate the Super Network application. The Acute Angle PC 
1st generation is considered to be an Acute Angle Cloud founder node, thus giving the owner 
the first Super Network activation code free of charge (free activation period is for 31 days, the 
Acute Angle PC 1st generation will be activated automatically after the client is updated (the 



  

  

 

 

  

user needs to update the client version). It needs to be activated again once the 31 days are over. 
According to the SN Token Reward algorithm and the AAC Reward algorithm, users are 
distributed SN and AAC rewards, among which the Acute Angle hardware users will still enjoy 
the original AAC reward distribution. 

 
 
AAC  and  SN  operating  mechanism  
  

Every user is a transmission node for the peer-to-peer network; AAC is acquired as a reward 
through sharing idle resources. Each New PC Network device will become a node and an independent 
server for data collection and transmission. 

 

AAC  Rewards  Algorithm  
AAC implements multi-dimensional scoring for rewards based on the Acute Angle hardware 

devices’ processing power, upstream bandwidth, shared hard disk space, etc. The Acute Angle 
hardware devices’ score represents the contribution in one day, and the AAC generated on the same 
day is distributed to Acute Angle hardware devices in the entire network according to the score weight. 

 

Acute Angle hardware devices score A = (hardware capability × (CPU factor + memory factor) 
+ bandwidth × bandwidth factor + stored value × stored value factor) × (effective online duration × 
24 hours × effective online duration factor) × total amount of the day =Ct; 

Production formula: 

!"#!$#!%#⋯ #!'    
× Ct 

 
Formula analysis 

•   Hardware capability: 
CPU efficiency and the Acute Angle devices’ memory. Currently, the Acute Angle PC has a 

consistent hardware ability, with an ability value of 1, CPU factor weight of 20, and memory factor 
weight of 10; 

•   Bandwidth: 
Upstream bandwidth (measured in trusted nodes). To encourage the participation of distributed 

nodes, the decay factor of bandwidth factor is 10 at 1-8M, 5 at 9-20M, and 1 at 21-100M; if the 
bandwidth is above 100M, it is calculated as 100M using a progressive algorithm (see below for 
details); 

•   Storage: 
The storage space available for sharing is measured from the trusted node. In order to encourage 

users to share their idle storage resources, the storage value is 0 when the storage space is less than 
200G, the storage value is 1 when the storage space is 200G-1000G, and the storage value is 2 when 
the storage space is greater than 1000G. The storage factor is 5; 

•   Read and write: 



  

  

 

 

The read-and-write is 1 when the read-and-write speed is 1MB / S-99MB / S; 
The read-and-write is 2 when the read-and-write speed is 100MB/S-200MB/s; 
The read-and-write is 3 when the read-and-write speed is above 200MB/s. 
The read-and-write factor is 10; 

•   Effective duration factor: 
The effective time factor is 1, the effective online duration is 24 hours for 7 consecutive days, 

the effective time factor is 1.1, during which, the effective time is interrupted. Then the effective time 
factor will be recalculated from 1. 

•   Online duration: 
The trusted node aggregates the effective online duration of the previous days every day, 

calculates the score of the entire network, and distributes the AAC. 
Acute Angle hardware devices’ Score Algorithm Example: 
1.  When the upstream bandwidth is 1M, the storage space is 100G, the read-and-write speed of hard 
disk is 20MB / s, and the PC is online 12 hours; 

PC Score= [1*(20+10) +1*10+0*5+1*10] *(12/24*1) =25 
2.  When the upstream bandwidth is 10M, storage space is 500G, the read-and-write speed of the hard 
disk is 50MB / s, and the PC is online 24 hours; 
PC Score= [1*(20+10) + [8*10+(10-8) *5] +1*5+1*10] *(24/24*1) =135 

3.  When the upstream bandwidth is 100M, storage space is 1500G, the read-and-write speed of the 
hard disk is 100MB / s, and the PC is online 24 hours; 

PC Score= [1*(20+10) + [8*10+(20-8) *5+(100-20) *1] +2*5+2*10] *(24/24*1) =280 
4.  When the upstream bandwidth is 100M, storage capacity is 1500G, the read-and write-speed of 
hard disk is 100MB / s, the PC is online 24 hours; the total duration is 7 * 24 hours; 
PC Score=[1*(20+10)+[8*10+(20-8)*5+(100-20)*1]+2*5+2*10]*(24/24*1.1)=308 

 

The coin decay algorithm 

1)  Decay period y: 
The period for each yield reduction y = 1 year (365 days) 
2)  Decay factor d: 
The proportion of each reduction adopts the halving method, d = 50% 
3)  The initial amount of coins C: 
The number of coins rewarded per online time is calculated based on the total amount and the 
C=620k/day. 

 

The yield of coins is halved every 365 days, meaning the total number of tokens generated from 
rewards indefinitely approximates 450 million. 



  

  

 

 

SN  Rewards  Algorithm  
  

SN is based on the hardware capabilities of the New PC Network equipment, bandwidth, sharable 
storage size, etc. to conduct multi-dimensional scoring incentives. The New PC Network equipment 
score is relative to its daily contribution, according to the score weight of the New PC Network entire 
network’s hardware distribution on the day that the token is generated. 

 
New PC Network device score P = (hardware capability × (CPU factor + memory factor) + bandwidth 
× bandwidth factor + stored value × stored value factor) × (effective online duration÷10  hours× 
effective online duration factor) × day’s total currency amount = Ct; 

 

Production formula: 
 ("  

("#($#(%#⋯ #('    
× Ct 

Formula analysis: 
 
 

•   Hardware capability: 
The CPU efficiency and memory size of the New PC Network hardware. When the CPU's main 
frequency is 1-3G, the factor weight is 20; when the CPU's main frequency is 3.1-4G, the factor 
weight is 30; when the CPU's main frequency reaches 4.1 or higher, the factor weight is 40; Equal to 
(threads/cores) *(cores/4). The memory weight is memory/4*10; 

 
•   Bandwidth 

The measured upstream bandwidth of the trusted node. In order to encourage the participation of 
distributed nodes, the bandwidth factor is 10 at 1-8M, 5 at 9-20M, 1 at 21-100M, and at 100M or 
more it is calculated as 100M using a progressive algorithm. 

 

•   Storage 
Measured by the trusted node. The storage space can be used to obtain rewards, and encourages users 
to share more of their own idle storage resources. The storage value is set to 0 when it is less than 
200G, 1 when it is 200G-1000G, and 2 when it is greater than 1000G. The storage factor is 5; 

 

•   Read and write: 
The read-and-write is 1 when the read-and-write speed is 1MB / S-99MB / S; 

The read-and-write is 2 when the read-and-write speed is 100MB/S-200MB/s; 
The read-and-write is 3 when the read-and-write speed is above 200MB/s. 
The read-and-write factor is 10; 

•   Effective duration factor: 



  
 

 

  

The effective time factor is 1, the effective online duration is 24 hours for 7 consecutive days, 
the effective time factor is 1.1, during which, the effective time is interrupted. Then the effective time 
factor will be re-calculated from 1. 

•   Online duration: 
The trusted node aggregates the effective online duration of the previous days every day, 

calculates the score of the entire network, and distributes the SN. 
 
 

The coin decay algorithm 

1)  Decay period y: 
The period for each yield reduction y = 4 years (1424 days) 
2)  Decay factor d: 
The proportion of each reduction adopts the halving method, d = 50% 
3)  The initial amount of coins C: 
The number of coins rewarded per online time is calculated based on the total amount and the 
C=ß16w/day. 

 
 

The yield of coins is halved every 4 years, meaning the total number of tokens generated from rewards 
indefinitely approximates 450 million.
