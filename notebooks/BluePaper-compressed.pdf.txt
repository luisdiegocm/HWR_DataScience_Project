Who We Are
➢ Actinium began as a hobby project, designed & written by a single developer. This project 

was created mainly to provide direct competition to the overwhelming influx of  scams, 
shady developers, and blatant abuse of  open-source technology. 

➢ The Actinium Network was launched on April 25th, 2018, with no pre-mine, no pre-sale, no 
founders rewards, and the development team owns no significant share of  (ACM) coins. 

➢ The Actinium development team has always been—and will always be—publicly visible. 
➢ Actinium leverages the latest Bitcoin and Litecoin codebases with a specific focus on the 

perpetual development of  future technologies and the empowerment of  users through an 
intuitive user experience.  

➢ Actinium provides stability against volatile speculation through our highly-motivated 
development plan that prioritizes longevity over short-term price action. 

➢ Actinium was created for everyone because we believe that it is People who collectively 
determine the value to things. Therefore, a cryptocurrency must work for everyone in 
order to be of  any value.  

➢ The Actinium team takes pride in offering a truly ethical, motivated, and technologically 
advanced cryptocurrency.



Goals

➢ Paper Wallets & Address-Generators 
➢ Mobile Wallets for Android & iOS 
➢ Hardware Wallet Integration 
➢ Electrum Servers & Clients 
➢ Tor Integration 
➢ SegWit & Bech32 Addresses 
➢ Lightning Network 
➢ Atomic Swaps 
➢ Smart Contracts 
➢ Exchanges 
➢ Education in Blockchain Technology, Security, and Lightning Network



Technology

➢ The Actinium codebase is built using the Litecoin code and follows the Bitcoin 
development branch. 

➢ The Actinium development team continuously integrates the latest blockchain 
technology features like Segregated Witness, Bech32 addresses, Tor, and much more. 

➢ Actinium is actively implementing second layer solutions such as Lightning Network by 
developing & porting tools for stable, simple on-boarding and adoption. 

➢ Actinium has successfully integrated Tor libraries because we firmly believe Privacy and 
Anonymity must be available to every cryptocurrency user via user-friendly 
applications. 

➢ Maintaining the Safety and Security of  all user(s) funds is of  the utmost importance. 
Thus, Actinium has full Hardware Wallet compatibility with Ledger Nano and Ledger 
Blue. (pending the approval of  the Ledger HQ Co.) 

➢ Actinium aims to support as many different miners as possible, therefore, we use the 
GPU-friendly Lyra2z algorithm that works effectively with both NVIDIA & AMD cards.  

➢ To further secure the network Actinium utilizes the LWMA as our preferred difficulty-
adjustment algorithm. 



Specifications

➢ Launched: 25th April 2018 
➢ Fair Launch: no premine, no airdrop, no ICO, no “founder rewards“ 
➢ Mining: PoW with GPU (NVIDIA & AMD) 
➢ Algorithm: Lyra2z - since block 55,000 
➢ Maximum Supply: 84,000,000 coins 
➢ Block Reward: 50 ACM - halving every 840,000 blocks (approx. every 4 years)  
➢ Block Time: 2.5minutes 
➢ SegWit: active since block 64,512 
➢ Bech32 Addresses: supported – prefix acm1 
➢ LWMA difficulty retargeting adjustment algorithm - since block 85,000 
➢ Tor Integration: activated with a single parameter - since version 0.17.5.0



Mining
➢ Actinium uses Lyra2z as a Proof-Of-Work Algorithm.  

➢ Advantages of  Lyra2Z: 
➢ Energy efficient algorithm 
➢ Keeps GPU cards from overheating 
➢ Lowers efficiency-gap between AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.  
➢ Currently ASIC, FPGA, & Botnet resistant 

➢ LWMA difficulty readjustment algorithm 

➢ Advantages of  LWMA:  
➢ Proven to be more effective at stabilizing hash-rate than the 2016-block algorithm 

used by Litecoin & Bitcoin. 
➢ Readjusts the difficulty every block; taking into account the calculations of  the 

last 60 blocks 
➢ Reacts quickly to large spikes in hash-rate.



➢ Mobile Applications

➢ Actinium Mobile Wallet is available for Android 
➢ iOS coming soon! 

➢ The iPhone version is currently in development.

Hardware Wallets

➢ Actinium is compatible with 
Ledger Nano S and Ledger Blue.  

➢ We have successfully completed 
tests of  our integration code. 

➢ Awaiting Ledger HQ‘s final 
approval.



Electrum Support

➢ To make using blockchains easier for our 
users we operate specialized Electrum 
Servers that support Actinium 

➢ We also offer an alternative Electrum SPV 
Wallet.



Tor Integration

➢ Actinium has supported the 
Tor anonymity protocol since 
v0.17.5.0. 

➢ To activate Tor, users need 
only enter a single parameter 
into their configuration file - 
everything else will be done 
automatically. 

➢ Additionally, we support 
Pluggable Transports to 
ensure censorship resistance 
against high-level Tor traffic 
blocking systems.



Zerocash, Zerocoin, and Stealth Addresses

➢ Actinium is currently testing the Zerocoin, Zerocash, and Stealth Addresses. 
➢ The Zerocash & Zerocoin protocols help anonymize user transactions making the 

Actinium Blockchain impervious to chain-analysis. 
➢ Zerocash enables confidential transactions by creating specialized Actinium coins 

that obfuscate any-and-all transaction data including transaction amounts, sender/
receiver identification information, and more.   

➢ Zero-Knowledge Proofs confirm the validity of  confidential transactions without 
revealing any details. 

➢ Stealth Addresses prevent any possible public association of  a transaction with a 
recipient’s wallet address. They conceal actual destination addresses thereby 
hiding the receiver's identity on Actinium’s network.

Lightning Network

➢ Actinium’s main priority is 
facilitating the adoption of  the 
Lightning Network. 

➢ We support SegWit, a necessary 
protocol for Lightning Network. 

➢ We also have activated our own 
Lightning Network that is based on  
c-lightning BOLT implementation.
