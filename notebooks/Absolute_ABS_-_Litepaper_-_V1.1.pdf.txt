This Litepaper is a cut down version of the whitepaper which is still in development. 

This paper assumes that you already have a basic understanding of the cryptocurrency 
environment.

The Coins Vision: 
Our vision is to provide an advertising, promotions and event platform with smart contracts 
that will have a global reach of network enablers. Our network will allow agents, organisers 
and promoters the ability to reach a global audience and utilise their participation to achieve 
their desired media goals. 
 
The network is driven by ultra-low transaction fees, reliable and fast transactions (10x faster 
than Bitcoin) which are supported by a large core network of Masternodes.  
 
Mainnet Development 
A newly developed Mainnet (specifications of which will be announced shortly) will be 
attached to the current blockchain. De-synchronous sidechain implementation for smart 
contracts will be initiated via collateral agent inputs and managed under escrow from upper 
tier nodes. 
 
Reward Structure  
Proof of Stake (POS), Proof of View (POV), Proof of Work (POW), Masternodes (MN) 
 

The ABS Cycle 
Absolute aims to incentivise a healthy balance of holding and liquidity. To do this we will split 
the reward structure as follows: 

 
Holding Incentives 
 

• Masternodes  
Masternodes are a way of earning rewards for holding coins: collateral is locked into 
the network allowing stability. In return, Masternodes take it in turn to process the 
network, receiving a reward for doing so. 

 
• POS 

If an individual cannot hold enough coins to activate a Masternode, they can earn 
rewards by holding over a specified amount until the coin matures. When this happens 
they will start to receive rewards in the form of ABS. 
 

Liquidity Incentives  
 

• POW 
Hashing power from mining will supply security and stability to the network. In return 
the network will offer 10% of the block chain reward structure to incentivise liquidity. 
 

• POV 
The Proof of View network is funded via smart contracts. Agents set contracts which 
are paid per interaction with the network. The interaction rewards are set by the agent. 
 
A reward is issued per successful interaction between certain ‘actors’. The reward 
distribution is set based upon the type of contract that is issued. These transactions 
allow ABS to be distributed to multiple individuals and can in turn be sold. This 
generates volume, formulating a new cycle.

*The current version V12.2.2a is using a Masternode collateral of 1000 ABS. This will 
be replaced by a 2500 ABS minimum requirement in the next version (V12.2.3a) which 
will then become the new base tier. 
 
 
Network Interaction 
Although the POV network is totally transparent, there is a collateral requirement that must 
be met to allow access to the POV Masternode network. These nodes process the POV 
transactions and administer contract escrow. They also provide agents, enablers, users and the 
network with rewards based on the interactions.  
 
In return for processing a POV interaction, the network will receive an additional reward on 
top of the block reward. In times of high network transactions, this will mean an increased ROI 
for POV Masternodes. 
 
The POV network controls the escrow funds held for each contract. When a contract 
interaction occurs, the POV network commands the POV nodes to release escrow funds to the 
required interactors at specific periods during the day.  
 
All transactions on the POV network are used to process ABS in an efficient way. This means 
that when there is high activity on the POV network it will have minimum effect on standard 
transactions on the ABS Mainnet.   
 
The POV network is controlled and maintained directly by the POV Masternodes including 
block sealing. There is no reward structure on this network, its primary use is to facilitate 
payment on the Mainnet and reward ‘actors’.

Network Terminology 
The POV network is made up of a number of ‘actors’. These are people that interact with the 
network to successfully process a transaction. 

• Agent  
Agents are the contract initiators. They purchase ABS from an exchange and then issue 
contracts based on their needs. 

 
• Enablers 

Certain contracts require ‘enablers’ to create adverts and distribute media, either in a 
physical form or online. If they have met the requirements of the contract and a lead is 
generated, they will receive a reward for their interactions. These rewards depend on 
the type of contract they are fulfilling.   

 
• Users 

These are end users who communicate with the enablers or agent via the network to 
produce an interaction. It is possible for users to be rewarded based on their 
interaction with certain contracts. 

 
• POV Nodes 

A POV node is the core network processor. Masternodes receive rewards for 
processing interaction information on the network.  

 

Tier network reward structure 
To keep the network fair for all users, there will be equal share of the block reward based on a 
1:1 ABS distribution offset against collateral. The upper tier nodes will receive rewards from 
the POV network as well, which will increase the ROI over the base tier.  
 
Base Tier Node collateral 

• 2500 ABS 

Upper Tier Node collaterals (POV Nodes) 

• 5,000 ABS 
• 10,000 ABS 
• 20,000 ABS (To be added at a later date) 
• 40,000 ABS (To be added at a later date)

Proof of View (POV) 

Proof of View allows network agents to form advertising, promotion or event based contracts. 
Agents must have an active connection to the network either via the wallet or via a website 
that is connected to a POV node. This website can be set up by Masternode holders that have 
the highest tier nodes. Contracts can be formed based on the following areas: 
 

• (LOC) Location based contracts qualified via an Apple or Android wallet 
 

o These rewards are based on an agent trying to attract people to a location for a 
specific reason such as, but not limited to, an event, conference, party or 
festival. 
 

• (PHY/ PHY-LOC) Physical based capture contracts qualified via an Apple or Android 
wallet. These are split into two areas based on pre-defined interactions: 
 

o (PHY) Media capture via a smart phone with the wallet installed.  
Before the campaign starts, adverts are catalogued and imported into the POV 
system, receiving an individual ID. The wallet will then match to this ID and will 
supply links to the advert which will generate a lead for the agent. 
 

o (PHY-LOC) Location media capture via a smart phone with the wallet installed. 
These must be in a certain location to receive rewards. This is a double 
verification process which combines standard physical based capture (PHY) 
and location.  
 

• (SAW) Social media and website based lead generation contracts. These come under 
two different criteria: 
 

o (SAW-U) Unqualified Leads – these interactions are not subsidised via the 
collateral buffer and can only be funded via the agent’s collateral alone: 
 
 Website adverts and banners processed via the network when an 

interaction occurs.  
 

 Outbound media, based on click per view. 
 

o (SAW-Q) Qualified Leads - these interactions are subsidised via the collateral 
buffer and can only be funded via the agent’s collateral: 
 
 Lead Generation which results in a detailed form submission or website 

order attached to the contract ID. 
 

• (UES) Users can become enablers by republishing media if the contract allows it. 

Most contracts are subsidised by the block reward structure via the collateral buffer.

Collateral Buffer 

The Collateral buffer is a stabilisation fund that bridges between the block reward and 
the POV network. It provides two outputs: 
 

• A Proof of View contracts subsidy. This allows a subsidy percentage based on the level 
of engagement in the POV system. High demand will reduce the subsidy to a lower 
percentage. Lower demand will increase the percentage until 20% of the contract value 
is met. 
  

• The second is an average output to counteract the dynamic adjustment algorithm that 
keeps the buffer full. This makes it fairer for Masternodes that received funds from the 
buffer overflow to receive a stable reward figure daily. This amount is split between the 
total number of nodes that have been active for more than one day and is transferred 
to all nodes on a daily basis. 
 

Loading conditions 
The reward structure is dynamically adjusted to allow the Collateral buffer to stay full based 
on demand. Here are a few loading condition examples: 
 
 

Block Reward Allocation 

POV 
Loading 

MN Collateral 
Overflow 

Collateral 
Funding 

POW  POS  Governance  

None* 40% 28% 2% 10% 10% 10% 

Medium 40% 15% 15% 10% 10% 10% 

High 40% 0% 30% 10% 10% 10% 

 
POV Loading Conditions explanation   
 

• None – The buffer is full and awaiting a smart contract to be initiated. All additional 
supply from the 28% allocation is diverted to the Masternodes and paid daily to all 
qualifying nodes.  
 

• Medium – The buffer is in use but requires funding from the reward structure to stay at 
the algorithm’s specific target. As only 50% of the block funding is required, the other 
50% is dispensed to the Masternodes and paid once a day to all qualifying nodes.  
 

• High – The buffer is being depleted rapidly and all available funding is initialised to 
restore collateral within the buffer. 

The buffer will always pull a minimum of 2% from the block reward. This allows growth of the 
fund over time in a sustainable way. The base size of the fund is allocated via Governance. The 
subsidy algorithm tracks demand for the fund and in turn increases or decreases the size of the 
fund and subsidy percentage accordingly.

POV Reward 
The POV reward system is funded by agents that wish to create smart contracts. Enablers, 
POV Nodes and users then receive percentages of the POV reward structure based on the 
type of interaction that is occurring in the contract.  
 
Subsidy amounts are adjusted based on loading conditions; the POV network will always 
receive a base percentage per contract. 

Below is a standard overview of the reward structure for different contract areas based on full 
load. 

Contract 
type 

Subsidy (SB)  Enabler  User POV 
Network 

Governance 

(LOC) 20% MAX  - 88% 10% 2% 
(PHY) 20% MAX  53%-(SB%) 40% (SB%)+5%* 2% 
(PHY-LOC)) 20% MAX  53%-(SB%) 40% (SB%)+5%* 2% 
(SAW-U) -  93%-(SB%) - (SB%)+5%* 2% 
(SAW-Q) 20% MAX  73%-(SB%) 20% (SB%)+5%* 2% 
(UES) 20% MAX  53%-(SB%) 40% (SB%)+5%* 2% 

 

*The POV network percentage will always be 5 % higher than that of the subsidy, except for 
LOC based contracts. 
 
Reward Allocation based on Tier level 

Tier Level POV allocation from interaction per click Governance Sway per ABS 
5,000 30% +2 % 
10,000 70% +5% 

 

Reward scenario for POV 
The table below is an average reward based on 10,000 ABS being spent in one day on the POV 
network. This is assuming that all contracts are equal in volume (5.8% POV Fee). This reward 
can be added to the standard block reward. These are extreme conditions based on each end of 
the loadings range. 

Tier Level ABS Contract Average from one Day 
 No Subsidy Reward in ABS Max subsidy Reward in ABS 
5,000 1.74% 174 20% + 1.74% 2174 
10,000 4.06% 406 20% + 4.06% 2406 

 
This is the total reward, which would need to be distributed equally across the tier level.
