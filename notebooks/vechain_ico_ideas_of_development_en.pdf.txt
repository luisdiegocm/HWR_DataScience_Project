Preface 

 

The VeChain team and the VeChain Blockchain platform has been running for more than 

two years. 

 

Fortunately, while running down the path of Blockchain which everyone has big hopes on 

right now, we met many people sharing the same goal and lots of enterprise customers 

that dare to explore this new area. We also met many passionate business partners and 

co-workers with strong believes. Moreover, we accumulated lots of experience of business 

use cases for different industries and we kept adjusting and making corrections during the 

process so that we can continue on searching the right way to use this “secret technology” 

that may change the world. 

  

Our original vision has never been changed. The dream is still same as before,  

 

Building a trust-free and distributed business ecosystem to enable transparent 

information flow, efficient collaboration, and high speed value transferring.

1. Concept Background  

1.1 Call for ICO  

 

The Blockchain technology is experiencing rapid development especially in 

recent one or two years. The change is so fast for us entrepreneur. Despite the 

direction is technology development and expansion, or application research, we 

face changes all the time. Every time we site together, discuss and conclude "the 

only thing that does not change is change itself", just like a poet. From the second 

half of 2015, with an article from The Economist “Blockchain: The Trust Machine”, 

the Blockchain technology started to walk out of the geek community and rapidly 

gained worldwide attention in various industries. 

 

The term “Blockchain" is no longer an obscure technical term for many people. 

Lots of the new ideas and projects are coming out, which includes many 

imaginative models and new directions for Blockchain. At the end of last year, the 

Blockchain technology was even written directly into the national "13th Five-Year 

plan", which encouraged us many peers. In addition, it attracts so many aspiring 

young people to join the Blockchain industry.  

 

Needless to say, Blockchain has been recognized by the world as a new 

generation of powerful technology. Blockchain is considered as being able to 

change the world again just like what the Internet technology did. In addition, 

based on the pattern of human technology development, the development 

process of the Blockchain technology will suddenly get speeds up by a huge 

margin without doubt. We believe that it will have substantial breakthroughs and 

extensive expansion in the upcoming few years for the Blockchain industry. 

 

However, the reality is tougher than expected. The application direction of 

Blockchain is either for financial industry or non-financial industry. For financial 

industry, it is so obvious with its high standard of compliance, so it is very hard to 

make a break through. For non-financial industry, it has a variety of collaborative 

cooperation modes but all these participants lack of drive to move further. That is 

why even though there is some new concepts derived from Blockchain, only few 

practical Blockchain business application has been established. Even when some 

project get partially established can make the teams feel excited. 

 

Although everything is hard at the beginning, there is always someone who is 

very careful and willing to be the first one to get into the field. In order to reduce 

the possibility of failure as much as possible, we want to share VeChain with the 

investors, enterprise customers, cooperative partners and colleagues – a product 

that we started making strategic plan two years ago. It has been through several 

platform software updates, many practical cases and debates with arguments at 



6 
 

so many sleepless nights. Finally we created some matured ideas and we want 

to CALL for the ICO for VeChain project.   

  

1.2 The Understanding of Blockchain Technology 

 

1.2.1 Synergy and Value Transfer 

 

In the world of traditional business, different varieties of collaborative and 

business operations as well as the whole financial industry, which is at the top of 

the "food chain", shows trust is the biggest cost in the field. Though Blockchain 

carries a "trust aura". The Blockchain technology is widely accepted around the 

world since the famous article " Blockchain: the trust machine" published by the 

Economist. 

 

The essence of a Blockchain is an Internet protocol and a collection of 

technologies about Trust. We can define the meaning of Blockchain from three 

dimensions - data, system and application: 

 From the data point of view: Blockchain is a distributed database system 

that is continuously updated in chronological order. The data can only be 

added but not tampered with.  

 From the system point of view: Blockchain is a distributed deployment and 

real-time synchronization system, allows participants from different 

parties to create and maintain the data through mechanism for consensus. 

It makes each active node on the Blockchain has exactly the same data. 

 From the application point of view: Blockchain is a standard global 

platform allows multiple participants to connect at the same time and 

records all digital objects, users, and their relative operations on this 

platform. 

 

With the development of information technology and Internet, the application of 

various systems makes the collaboration more convenient and efficient. Because 

of the existence of trust issue, the majority of such efficient collaboration exists 

mainly within an enterprise or a certain organization. However, people are using 

the methods and tools from 40 years ago when it comes to the collaboration 

between different enterprises. The majority of collaboration is still completed by 

e-mail. System interfacing is actually not as simple as imagined. Since it involves 

data security, trade secrets, cooperation, trust and other problems. The 

connection is not just a technical issue. In addition, due to the same problem, the 

financial service that match and support all kinds of business needs improvement 

in both efficiency and cost. 

 

For example, a classic business collaborative mode includes supply chain (as the 

graphic shows below), brand, manufacturer, distributed retailer, consumer and 

regulator. All the parties share the same goal: to achieve the same value of 



7 
 

improving the life quality of the consumer. However, even if the different 

enterprises worked together for the same goal, due to the lack of sufficient trust 

guarantee, the cooperation is still on a peer-to-peer manner and with traditional 

communication tools, and the data exchange will be very inefficient and expensive. 

In such a traditional product life cycle, even if the logistics could be relatively 

smooth and efficient, the flow of information is often fragmented and the transfer 

of funds is also relatively slow. For the participants on the whole supply chain, the 

utilization rate of funds has always been quite a headache.  

 

The Blockchain technology can help us to establish a new trust-free sharing 

business collaboration model (as the graphic shows below). Various parties can 

ensure the security of data in a more convenient and smoother manner. With the 

support of a more timely and accurate information flow, the value transmission in 

the ecological environment can be developed and executed during the business 

activities. This way each enterprise can increase the utilization rate of funds, and 

greatly improve the speed of value transmission in order to support more business 

development. 

 

 
Figure 1.2.1 Distributed business collaboration from traditional business collaboration to Blockchain 

1.2.2 Data and Information Symmetry 

 

Most enterprises have three types of data: 

1) Public data, such as enterprise data that is publicly available on the official 

website. 

2) Private data, such as enterprise product developing documents, financial 

reports for non-listed companies. 

3) Permitted shared data, usually exists between different cooperation 

partners. Such as the record data from the identification, logistics, 

payment information and after-sale service for different level enterprises.  

 

The first and second kind of data are generally well understood. The interesting 

part is the third type of data, which is usually converted into private data by the 

participants.  

 



8 
 

For example, after a car is sold, maintenance data exists in the 4S store or the 

maintenance business. When the owners need to buy insurance, the insurance 

company spend huge cost to buy those maintenance data as a service provider. 

Or, based on the market demand, this could become as a new data service. This 

service can collect data, centralize maintenance and management, and get paid 

by providing data to participants who are interested in those data. For users, the 

risk comes from the centralized/ isolated data, where stay in a variety of online 

automotive service platform. This kind of service breaks the asymmetric 

information (due to the difference of region and time) by using information 

technology, and constructs a new centralized asymmetric information, and then 

produce profit base on this. 

 

We BELIEVE that the Blockchain technology can continuously break those 

asymmetric information and allow data to return to the real owner eventually. For 

instance, in the car scenario described above, the data generated by the owner 

when he used the car should naturally be owned by the owner. That means the 

data generated from car maintenance should belong to car owner without doubt. 

While enjoying other service like insurance later, insurance company can reduce 

data audit costs through user authorized credible data. Thus car owners could 

enjoy premiums service with lower cost.  

 

The Blockchain technology allows data owners really own the data, and let the 

data owner have the authority to choose whether to share their data, which 

completely breaks the traditional asymmetric of the centralized information. In this 

way, the value goes back to where they were. The data owned by one side needs 

to be shared and maintained by all parties. Thus new values are generated and 

is properly allocated in the activities of multi-party participation. 

 

1.3 VeChain’s Vision 

 

What does the VeChain want to do? The vision of VeChain is to build a trust-

free and distributed business ecosystem based on the Blockchain 

technology self-circulated and expanding. 

  

 In this ecosystem, the information is relatively transparent and 

symmetrical. A large portion of the source of the profit comes from the 

realization of true value, and only a small portion of it comes from 

asymmetric information (absolute symmetry does not exist). 

 In this ecosystem, each business party can reduce the potential trust 

issue between different parties. This makes business cooperation simpler, 

more efficient, low cost, and the business can concentrate resources on 

more advanced technology, better product and service to create more 

value. 

 In this ecosystem, each person and each enterprise can find their own 



9 
 

place. Based on their contribution and value, they can obtain relatively fair 

reward. 

 In this ecosystem, the technology of Blockchain should have room for all 

aspects of business, including commercial activities and economic 

activities that should be supported. 

 In this ecosystem, the value is in a closed loop that keep expanding 

accompanied by the development of commercial activities with high-

speed transmission. The form of value may be commodities, services, or 

direct fund. 

 

1.3.1 Distributed Business Ecosystem 

 

In the ecological environment made by VeChain, there are several main types of 

participants: 

 

1) Enterprise organization  

All kinds of enterprise organization that provide products and services to 

end-users to meet all the needs such as various manufacturing enterprises, 

brands, service providers for end-users, and so on. 

2) Application service provider  

It means an enterprise that provides various application development and 

services for enterprise organizations and users on VeChain Blockchain. 

The product or service can be a variety of decentralized applications and 

services to users, technical products and related services for all enterprises 

and institutions, functions of the government agencies, regulators and third 

party credit service providers. 

For example, end-user oriented Internet platforms like BAT, sharing 

products and service providers like Uber, Didi, Airbnb; 

For instance, enterprise oriented technology, product, service provider such 

as Oracle, IBM. Supply chain services providers of commodity enterprises, 

third party credit service providers such as PwC, DNV, GL and financial 

service providers such as banks and insurance companies. 

3) Smart contract service provider  

Organizations provide VeChain smart contract technology service to 

enterprises, and allow the end- enterprise or service providers to develop 

Blockchain applications in a faster and more convenient manner. 

4) VeChain network node provider  

Enterprises and organizations that directly participate in the Blockchain 

network and maintain a certain number of nodes to protect the overall 

network security. 

Maintaining a specific function node to provide related services, such as 

customs, quality inspection node, audit node, wallet service, and user 

private key management service provider. 

5) VeChain Foundation  



10 
 

VeChain is responsible for the construction of Blockchain network, 

technology research and development, upgrade and maintenance and 

other basic technical services. Meanwhile, in the initial stage it is 

responsible for business development, creating reference cases, 

encouraging and supporting more of the new smart contract service 

providers and existing technology enterprises to transform. Based on the 

demands of ecological development, it provides support to more 

technology companies on offering Blockchain services, such as wallet 

development, payment services, private key management, internal 

exchange, smart contract templates etc. 

6) End-user 

The service target of end-enterprise, end-users and service provider 

(investors) enjoy the bonus from the future commercial ecology 

development together.  

These participants set up the whole VeChain distributed business 

ecosystem. On one hand, it can form an effective closed loop. On the other 

hand, it can connect and assimilate with the environment outside of the 

ecosystem and constantly grow itself, as figure shows below: 

 

 

Figure 1.3.1 Distributed business ecosystem environment 

 

 

1.3.2 The "Blood" in the Distributed Ecosystem – VeChain Token(VET) 

 

If the entire distributed business ecosystem is a body, then the Blockchain 

infrastructure is the skeleton and various application services are the muscles and 

organs. Such body needs the circulation of the blood, and the blood is the 

VeChain tokens - VeChain Token(VET), carrying the value transfer function of the 

entire Blockchain network and various commercial activities running on it. 

VeChain Token(VET) will be openly available for sale in a variety of ways in this 

ICO. 



11 
 

 

As the carrier of value transmission in the whole ecosystem, VeChain Token(VET) 

flows through the smart contract which describes and executes the cooperation 

among the parties, as well as forming a special closed loop with an open interface. 

On one hand, the value transfer very fast in the ecological. On the other hand, it 

opens and communicates with outside the ecosystem as a medium, and further 

expanding the scope of ecology. 

 

The main function of VeChain Token(VET) is to circulate as much as possible and 

to let each participant use it. So we will sell more than 70% of the total amount of 

tokens to communities, businesses, and users. 

 

Just as the graphic shows above:  

1) This loop begins with the end-user and enterprises as investors to use ETH 

to obtain VeChain Token(VET) in the beginning. VeChain uses ETH to 

perform technical development, commercial application cooperation 

promotion, and Blockchain services support. 

2) VeChain Foundation receives VeChain Token(VET) from each smart contract 

development and service provider to pay for the GAS needed to run the smart 

contract and maintain the operation of each business smart contract. The 75% 

to 99% of the VeChain Token(VET) income will be awarded as a node reward 

to the node provider, while the remaining 25% will be used for the daily 

operation, business promotion and technical development of the VeChain 

Foundation. 

3) Smart contract service providers use VeChain Token(VET) to pay for GAS 

and provide smart contract service of BaaS (Blockchain as a service). 

According to different business rules and contributions, each participant 

receives VeChain Token(VET) from its client - Application Development 

provider provides smart contract services through collecting VeChain 

Token(VET).  

4) Application provider develops and processes based on end-user’s needs with 

the foundation of smart contract service, as well as providing products for the 

application of the traditional enterprise customers or end-users and receive 

VeChain Token(VET) as corporate income. 

5) End-users can pay VeChain Token(VET) to obtain enterprise products and 

services.  

 

Of course, such ecological development will experience different stages, and 

maintain an open status. A better fusion with the traditional business world will 

help the transformation of traditional commercial enterprises, and then expand 

such a distributed business ecosystem. 

 

In this process, there must be a variety of new technology service enterprises, to 

provide a bridge for communication and value transfer between traditional 



12 
 

commercials and VeChain’s distributed business environment.  

 

VeChain will be responsible for the actual development. On the other hand, we 

will encourage and support outstanding teams to join us so we can have a better 

understand to the various sectors of all enterprises. We can apply better and more 

focus on developing and make the right people to do what they do best. 

 

According to the actual experience of the past two years, we have summed up a 

few reference methods to carry out this ecological promotion: 

1) The breakthrough point should select the enterprise with most 

"Blockchain" strategy. These enterprises value greatly on the 

development of Blockchain technology in the future. 

2) Initial cases should be combined with the real enterprise issue, which can 

solve the actual problems, or may bring new value. 

3) The business scenario has the multi participants, and space for deeper 

expansion. 

4) Target enterprises, target cases in the industry or in different industry has 

considerable influence. 

 

In this ecological development, the tactics needs to expand both horizontally and 

vertically:  

1)  Horizontally, make more duplicated expansion of the same types of 

enterprises within the same industry. 

2)  Vertically, the expansion of different enterprises and participants. 

 

More participants will bring more extensive collaboration, more efficient value flow, 

give birth to a new and strong coupling business model, and then build a future 

distributed business ecology. 

 

1.4 VeChain’s Attitude on Blockchain Technology  

 

The development of any new technology is bound to go through several important 

stages: 

 The first stage, technical barriers stage; at this stage, being capable 

or not capable plays a very big difference; doing well and not well is not 

very obvious. 

 The second stage is the business barrier stage. At this stage, the 

development of technology has been advancing by leaps and bounds, 

and with the trend of social resources, more and more talents have been 

pouring in. More technical theories and skills are being shared, and 

technical barriers are becoming increasingly blurred. To do or not to do 

already is not a problem; well done and badly becomes prominent. The 

key point of this stage is whether we can apply the technology skillfully 

and reasonably to the actual commercial products and services and 



13 
 

produce greater value. 

 The third stage is the scale barrier stage. At this stage, the snowball 

effect is very obvious, and the scale advantage is becoming more and 

more important. More business activities and social activities focus on 

one or more ecological environments, and the more participants, the 

faster they develop. 

 The fourth stage is the subdividing the vertical phase. At this stage, 

the industry scale and pattern are basically formed, and new 

breakthroughs are made. The new breakthrough comes from the 

division of vertical areas with more concentrated resources advantages 

to produce better products, services and values.  

 The fifth stage, the birth of the new technological revolution. More 

advanced technology was born in the human pursuit of higher value, 

and then enter the next cycle.  

 

Blockchain has no exemption to this route. Although the Blockchain technology 

itself still has a long way to go, there is lots of space for improvement. 

Nevertheless, as things stand now, we have unwittingly entered the early second 

stage of Blockchain. 

 

So, this non-whitepaper does not include mysterious algorithms and technical 

details. It focuses on the concept and design of the business ecosystem, and the 

support and further development needs of the related technologies. 

 

We hope that our investors, partners and communities will be able to come 

together and build this ecosystem together. 

 

We recognize that VeChain technology may not be the most advanced in the 

world. VeChain had a good technical starting point and a cohesive technical team 

and continuous iterations based on the needs of the application. In the process, 

we will be very grateful if VeChain could contribute our discovery and 

breakthroughs to the community, industry and Blockchain technology.  

 

2. Methodology and Technical Support   

 

2.1 Methodology 

 

Based on the understanding and following the objective of business rule, VeChain 

wants to begin with the smallest elements in business (people, object and money). 

VeChain wants to digitalize all of these small elements and build a general type 

of connection. VeChain builds the reflection on the coordinating activities of 

modern business through different smart contracts. It provides related value flow 

tool and system in order to create a new business model based on this 



14 
 

coordination pattern. After that VeChain builds a new kind of distributed business 

ecosystem that will be operated on Blockchain.  

 

1) Digitalized the objective in a common way. The result by this digitalization 

can technically be accepted and used by any of the participant. VeChain 

uses the unified VID to mark the object and make a connection between 

the hashed data and VID in order to build the corresponded target data 

to VID. It also helps to IoT technology to complete the connection 

between VID and real life target.  

2) To build a relationship type of connection with different object data by 

using the smart contract. 

3) To use the abstract smart contract to cooperate relevant authorizations 

to composite modelling and customization, reflecting the different 

business activities in the business world.   

4) A brand new digital asset (VeChain Token(VET)) that can provides the 

support of high speed value transaction. 

5) Create a new trustworthy interconnect business model. 

6) Different business model communicate and merge together to build a 

distributed business ecosystem.  

 

Through this method, we can “translate” the target product, participants and 

business activities from the real business world into the world of VeChain. We 

can combine all enterprise, customers, and government resource and data 

information from different industries. In this way we can digitalize the cooperation 

and systematize the operation. So it can reduce the cost of the industries and 

even the whole society. It can also improve efficiency since resource can be 

optimized distributed and all kinds of brand new business model will be born.  

  

Figure 2.1 Standard digitalization in the traditional world 

 

2.2 Technique Support  

 

The path of VeChain’s technology development is almost identical as the 

Blockchain technology. The initial idea was generated from the middle of 2015 

and then VeChain started doing a series of technology verification (TPOC). 



15 
 

 

At the very beginning of the technology verification, we tried to use Bitcoin 

network (UTXO) to build the module and use Colorcoin to make VID come true. 

SideChain technology improves the speed of the trade performance so that the 

system can face the future business challenge. In the end of 2015, the smart 

contract of Ethernet has been improved step by step and we worked for it. We 

also made huge modifications and technical innovation to commercial 

requirement and Ethereum Fork based on the open source. Based on the 

customers and project survey, we kept improving the system in the September of 

2016. For instance, we increased the data embedding and read performance to 

300TX/s and we also improved the data security control in the bottom layer 

structure of the enterprise. In addition, we made joint development with CHAOS 

data management model, the IoT technology, the Blockchain technology and 

many different business smart contract.  

 

Overall, the logic behind VeChain technology is always surrounded by business 

application. The idea of VeChain’s management is practical requirement leads 

product design, product design leads product development and product 

development leads practical requirement. 

  

In the whole process of evolving, our technical team got many supports from lots 

of great leaders, like the founder of the Ethereum- Vitalik, the founder of Jaxx- 

Anthony and many others. We feel grateful and appreciate of your open mind and 

the passion to the technology innovation  

 

2.3 Technical Structure 

 

Vechain’s structure is based on application needs, and make standardized 

abstraction for every single technical structure layer. It enables every single layer 

to have the independent universality and let every model in each layer combine 

to each other efficiently. The standard unit model have tens of thousands 

combination of the application. 

 

Below is the figure of Vechain’s overall structure: 



16 
 

 

 

Figure2.3 VeChain’s technical structure 

 

 



17 
 

The structure is separated mainly by two parts of abstract layer: Blockchain 

abstract layer and business abstract layer. 

 

Blockchain abstract layer: 

1) It is the bottom structure of the basic layer. The technical focus is to fork 

Ethereum codebase and improve based on this, it includes: 

a. DBGP- after maintained a certain level of security, then making a dynamic 

change for Block based on needs and requirements. This way it saves 

many storage space and system recourse cost. On the other hand, this 

protocol helps VeChain network to have 3 times better of efficiency than 

Ethereum after maintaining the security level. 

b. DMBSP- combine with the traditional safety technique to cooperate with 

Blockhchain’s mining system in order to give enterprise level Blockchain 

application to provide data security protection. 

c. DGIP- Implanting the data within the same category. 

d. Under Development- -BLACP- storing Blockchain data with classification 

and use to differentiate saved data with different time and value. 

e. Under Development - - PBCP- to distributed implanting and reading data 

with the same blockchain category. 

f. Under Development - - DCCP- Syncing the data with different categories 

of Blockchain. 

2) The upper level is the smart contract abstract layer for building a standard 

and modularity smart contract module (SSCU) in order to combine further, 

customized to face different industry, enterprise and smart contract for 

application scene (ASCM). Currently the smart contract inventory (VSCL) 

includes VID registration, data connection, status data implement, digital 

ownership, ownership transfer, authorization declaring, authorization transfer, 

multiple authorization and so on.  

3) Building a Blockchain connector standard protocol (BGAP) to connect with 

upper business application layer based on the foundation.  

 

Business application abstract layer: 

1) In this bottom of this layer is the basic service abstract layer. The purpose is 

mainly to do a secondary operation for the smart contract of the bottom layer 

to build GBSM. It includes –hashing Storage service, a service model for 

CHAOS through URS. Meanwhile, this layer contains a special customized 

module for the data from the bottom layer. It includes index service for 

Blockchain browser, UDAS, HDMS, DCASS, CNS and DGS which includes 

the standard basic functions for smart contract on VeChain to save the time 

on deploying customized smart contract. 

 

For this layer in the future, people will develop tools for visualized smart 

contract and through the service to build connections with smart contract. So 

even developers from different industries, or with no Blockchain experience 



18 
 

can deploy and develop smart contract in order to push the application for the 

industry.  

2) On top of this, the interface between the basic service layer and the business 

application layer is implemented for the two level application interface layer. 

The core of the development is standardization and to build the connection of 

business system that faces different types of data. In addition, accumulating 

more standard types by using application for many big enterprise that faces 

SAP, WMS and Salesforce, etc. As well as some common used website and 

mobile application connection. 

3) The top layer is business application abstract layer. It has standard application 

process module for different business scenes, different business practical 

developing module. So it can make the delivery and deployment for the 

development of the final application more convenient and fast. The developer 

of this layer does not even require to have any knowledge of Blockchain 

development so this can make more developers and technical service 

providers to use VeChain as the application of final customer development for 

Blockchain. 

 

 

2.4 Achieve the Technical Details 

 

VeChain’s Blockchain is forked and improved based on Ethereum codebase. The 

basic technical index can see Ethereum’s whitepaper as reference.  

 

Below we are going to focus on discussing the technical application feature of 

VeChain. 

 

2.4.1 VeChain ID Creation and Hashing 

 

VeChain IDs are created by using a sha256 function which generates a random 

ID which is hashed before being written into a NFC, QR Code or RFID tag(s) to 

be used for each product.  

 

All IDs are hashed by using a sha256 function which goes as follows: SHA25 

6(domain + '.' + ID)[12:]. In which the domain is the qualified name of table that 

the ID settled. e.g. “com.VeChain.dbname.tablename" 



19 
 

 
Figure 2.4.1 the creation of VID and hashing 

 

2.4.2 Storage of VID on Blockchain 

 

As previously mentioned, the hashed VeChain ID is written into tag(s) depending 

on the client’s needs. After the tags are ready, they go to a testing process and 

are “activated”. Activation is done by using a custom-made software called “V-

Operation” which can either run on Mobile or desktop operating systems. Upon 

activation, the ID is then written into Blockchain and replicated among all nodes. 



20 
 

 

Figure 2.4.2 The storage of VID on Blockchain 

 

2.4.3 Digital Ownership on Blockchain 

 

VeChain uses a custom-tailored Smart Contract which enables authorization-

based digital ownership management. The ownership of objects, represented 

by VeChain ID is linked to an account with the key pairs combined with public key 

and private key. 

 

The public key is public and known as alias email address which can be 

recognized and accessed by anyone. The private key is to represent the 

authorization and access, just like a password, to the objects with the 

corresponding public key. The ownership management is to set a specific linkage 

between the objective ID and the public key of owner who controls the 

corresponding private key. 

 



21 
 

 

Figure 2.4.3 Digital ownership on Blockchain 

 

2.4.4 Data Hashed Storage (proof of data) 

 

VeChain accepts any type of data: (strings, numbers, booleans, etc). Data is 

identified by its hash (SHA256). Sample for accessing data via RESTFUL APIs: 

 

• Store data 

• POST https://domain/hss/ 

 

• Retrieve data 

• GET https://domain/hss/{hash} 

 

The data is self-verifiable. When the data is retrieved, it can be verified by 

comparing its hash to the hash provided. 

 

 
Figure 2.4.4 Data hashed storage

https://domain/hss/%7bhash%7d


22 
 

 

 

2.4.5 API Gateway 

 

Universal application architecture interface designed for complex processes. The 

API gateway is the main entry for all API requests, it encapsulates the internal 

structure of the application, and the client only needs to interact with the gateway 

without calling a particular service. When the internal structure of the upgrade or 

new features, the client is completely transparent, the client does not need to 

consider too many changes in access, only need to ensure that the exchange 

protocol is correct.  

 

The following is about the network topology graph of the API gateway, 

deployment graph and functional graph. 

 

 

 

Figure 2.4.5-1 API Gateway-1 

 

The resources of a server are limited, and the characteristics of the horizontal 

expansion make it possible for large-scale access. Different instances of the 

same service can guarantee a service request shunt by API Gateway. In API 

Gateway we can use different access policy like consistent-hash, ip-hash, 

random access or priority access. At the same time, API Gateway and Service 

Discovery Service also can be scale out on-demand. 



23 
 

 

 

Figure 2.4.5-2 API Gateway 

 

2.4.6 Service Discovery (SDP) 

 

The API gateway needs to know the location (IP address and port) of each micro 

service that it communicates with. In traditional applications, it may be hard to 

connect this location, but now that it is based on cloud-based micro-service 

applications, which is not an easy problem to solve. Infrastructure services 

typically have a static location that can be specified by the OS environment 

variable. However, determining the location of an application service is not that 

simple. The application services are dynamically allocated, and a set of instances 

of a single service can also change dynamically with automatic scaling or 

upgrades. 

 

Service discovery has two major modes: client discovery mode and server 

discovery mode. We are using the server-side discovery mode. The client makes 

a request to a service through the API gateway, the API Gateway queries the 

service registry, and forwards the request to an available service instance. The 

biggest advantage of the server-side discovery model is that the client does not 

need to focus on the details of the discovery, simply sending the request to the 

API gateway, which reduces the discovery logic that the programming language 

framework needs to complete. 

 

The service registry is the core of the service discovery and is the database that 

contains the network address of the service instance. The service registry needs 

to be highly available and updated at any time. The service instance we uses the 

self-registration mode. So the service instance needs to be responsible for 

registering and logging out in the service registry. In addition, a service instance 



24 
 

also sends a heartbeat to ensure that the registration information is not obsolete. 

 

We choose etcd as a backend high availability, distributed, consistent key store 

for shared configuration and service discovery. 

 

2.4.7 Micro-Service 

 

Micro-service is the generic term for all backend VeChain services. This type of 

service can be customized according to the actual business interface to keep the 

separation between different businesses. Micro service can guarantee the service 

gray scale release, fast service upgrade or downgrade level. In our API Gateway 

ecosystem, the micro-service should provide below basic functions. 

 

1) Register& UnRegister 

Micro-service must be the initiative to register self to Service Discovery 

Service (SDS) when start up and must be unregister self when shutdown. 

SDS has 30sec to hold instance states, if unregistered when shutdown, 

after 30sec it will also be removed from service registry. 

2) Report service health 

SDS never know whether instances at backend are still available for 

serving. So microservice must report self-healthy in time and report interval 

must less than 30sec. 

 

Micro-services are more complicated than traditional service, especially 

communicating between service and service at the backend. Currently 

service discovery service need instance to register self, so all instance 

need a logic that register to it. In the next time we should consider a 3rd 

party of register service for leverage. These service can deploy an instance 

of micro-service, and can config some information for it, can check instance 

health and report to SDS. So micro-service just can be consider a pure app 

for serving API. 

 

2.4.8 Hashed Storage Service (HSS) 

 

Hashed Storage Service (HSS) is a distributed storage service, which provides 

services such as digital files, pictures, text data and any other object-oriented 

reliable storage. Through the combination with VeChain, stored in various types 

of objects, HSS will ensure that the data cannot be tampered with. At the same 

time, the uploaded object, unless authorized by the uploader, otherwise it cannot 

be obtained and modified by improper means. 

 

The HSS is mainly composed of two parts: object storage service and basic 

storage service. Object storage service is responsible for external interaction, 

save the object, access to objects and authorized object access; Basic storage 



25 
 

service is responsible for computing the object storage footprint, cut the object 

and the actual storage. 

 

With the development of service scale, in order to system reliability, Data often 

need to be backed up. The number of backups per data is at least one copy, or 

even ensure the reliability of the backup, the number of backups may be two or 

more. This makes the storage utilization rate of only or less, each TB of data need 

to occupy at least 2TB of storage space. As data grows, the cost of replication 

becomes more and more obvious, with traditional replicas equivalent to at least 

100 percent more storage overhead. Why distributed storage can help you setup 

a highly-available storage system with a single object storage deployment. With 

distributed service, it can simplify the data backup program, reduce disk space, 

but also make services available, improve data’s availability and durability.  

 

Erasure Code & Reed Solomon In the storage system. The erasure code 

technology is mainly through the use of mathematical algorithm to verify the 

original data to be verified to achieve the purpose of fault tolerance. It can be 

used to reconstruct missing or corrupted data. Reed-Solomon (RS) code is a 

storage system that more commonly used in an erasure code. Our Storage 

Service use RS algorithm to shard objects into and parity blocks. You can lose as 

many as drives (be it parity or data) and still reconstruct the data reliably from the 

remaining drives. Amazon S3 Compatible the APIs In the low level is compatible 

with the Amazon S3 API. 

 

Compatibility will lead to data access bonuses. Most developers are familiar with 

Amazon's S3 service and are familiar with how to use its API. A compatible 

interface reduces the possibility of external access.

2.5 Blockchain and IoT 

 

In 1999, the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed by a British Scholar 

Kevin Ashton in MIT. After discussed with many senior level managers from 

different enterprise, Ashton defines IoT to: 

 

“A network containing all ‘smart’ devices with some sort of sensing mechanism that 

can communicate via the internet with other smart devices or the cloud, without 

human interaction.” 

 

We can see IoT with mainly two parts – Perception and Connection based on this 

definition. 

 Perception is the idea of digitalized the real world data, like temperature, 

humidity, similar environment type data and personal ID.  

 Connection is sharing the digital information through Bluetooth, WIFI and 

mobile internet. 

 

In the future, he trends of IoT will be widely used, more different types, high sales 

and fast development. It will have a huge impact on the global industries. By 

quantity, the sales amount of IoT equipment will increase as a rate of 15% to 20% 

in the near future. IDC predicted that sales amount of IoT equipment will hit 45 

billion in year 2020. 

 

2.5.1 The Issue of IoT  

 

The issue of IoT technology has been discovered in the nineties. Until June of 

2016, 3GPP announced “release 13” and defined the IoT connection standard. 

This solves the four issues of IoT: Limitation of the connection capacity, limitation 

of coverage area, low standby time and high cost. Since September of 2016, 

every mobile device manufacturers released IoT connection plan for business. 

This focus the concept of different application can choose eMTC, NB-IoT, EC-

GSM and other different technology. 

 

With the new IoT standard, it has the feature of great connection, huge coverage 

area, low energy waste and low budget cost. Since then, IoT industry started to 

grow rapidly. However, we believe there are still three major issues for IoT: 

fragmentation of the standard Communication protocol, high cost of development 

and maintenance and lack of privacy, but these issues can be solved by 

Blockchain perfectly.  

 

2.5.2 Blockchain and IoT 

 



27 
 

Currently, there are many exploration on different IoT and Blockchain application 

on smart system. When those are applied on IoT, the concept of IoT opened up 

a road of innovation with unlimited possibilities. The Blockchain technology can 

be used as tracking the usage history of different equipment. It can also help to 

complete the trade with different equipment. This technique can provide the data 

transaction within different equipment that makes IoT equipment independent.  

 

Blockchain will realize the self-management and maintenance of the equipment. 

It saves the huge maintenance cost of cloud system and reduce the maintenance 

budget for IoT equipment. The private key that made by the equipment will ensure 

personal data won’t be stolen by strangers. It increases the safety level of IoT and 

the economic effectiveness with the combination of these two concepts. 

 

We believe that the IoT technology and the Blockchain technology cannot be split 

in the application. From the view of self-development for IoT, IoT wants to build a 

world with everything connecting to each other and this process requires three 

steps: 

1) It requires a unified communication standard between one thing and another. 

It means the equipment can communicate with the same language no matter 

where this equipment was built. IoT standard that published by 3GPP provides 

a physical channel for thing. In addition, the Blockchain technology provides 

logic language for thing and this makes different types of IoT equipment 

communicate with one unified language. 

2) With the foundation of the unified language, personal Identification will be 

required during the communication between different things. Then it needs a 

standard identification code system to support the unified language. This 

means the Blockchain technology is the best solution to unify different 

manufacturers and the identification code will not be controlled by anyone.  

3) With unified language and personal identification, the connection between 

those two will require more cooperation and business activities. This means 

smart contract needs to be built and digital currency will become the 

transmission carrier since the value needs to be transferred during the 

cooperation at the same time.  

 

As a technology that provides the service of trust, Blockchain can ensure the true 

effectiveness of data on the Blockchain network, IOT is the key to ensure the true 

effectiveness of data when it’s been uploaded from the first time from the original 

source.  

 

On the one hand, IoT helps to establish the congruent relationship between the 

real physical world and Blockchain world. On the other hand, the IoT technology 

can reduce the disturbing factors from the source to ensure the true effectiveness 

of data. 

 



28 
 

2.5.3 VeChain and IoT 

 

VeChain technology team contains a very important component – the IoT 

technology team. They focus on the responsibility to coordinate the IoT 

development with Blockchain application, which includes: 

1) Encrypted chips tag technology development. 

2) The identification of IoT sensor and data security. 

3) Security and authorization module of NB-IoT.  

 

IoT equipment is very complexed and we need to classify them with different point 

of views: 

 From the point of view of power supply 

 Equipment with power source: equipment with battery equipped, like 

temperature sensor, GPS. 

 Equipment with no power source: equipment with no battery 

equipped, like NFC. 

 Mixed equipment: Equipment with battery equipped and can also 

get power from other places. 

 From the point view of communication distance: 

 Close range distance equipment: resolve the communication within 

10 meters distance, like NFC(1 meter), RFID(10 meters), 

bluetooth(10 meters), etc. 

 Middle range distance equipment: resolve the communication within 

1 kilometre, like WiFi, sub 1g, lora, etc. 

 Long range distance equipment: resolve the communication with 

more than 1 kilometre, like NB-IoT, etc. 

 

We upgrade traditional IoT equipment on the chip layer and put personal 

identification with asymmetric key algorithm. 

 

 Personal identification: Every IoT equipment requires a unique 

identification on the network and this ID can be identified by other 

participants within the network. We enciphered each different equipment 

or object to ensure the code is unique and cannot be recognized.  

 Asymmetric key algorithm: asymmetric key algorithm is the foundation 

of the internet and the important feature of Blockchain. It can identify and 

authorize the equipment based on the identification of equipment. 

Through public and private key algorithm, we can identify if the 

equipment could connect to the network, if the digital data source were 

reliable, or if smart contract can be operated. To ensure the safety level 

of asymmetric algorithm, we will put the private key in the safety area so 

it cannot be read. In addition, asymmetric algorithm runs with the 

processor’s safety mode and it can ensure the safety during the process 

of calculation. 



29

2.6 Technical Testing 

 

VeChain team follows the procedure of professional software testing. Software 

should be predictable and stable and meet the standard of the product so there 

should be no unexpected results. With the digital information keep expanding, 

complicating and smart, the development of software testing is improving as well. 

With the maturation and systematizing of theory and practical, it shows more 

impact during the software quality check. General experience suggests that in a 

typical coding project, software and system testing cost about 50% of project time 

and over 50% of total cost. 

 

The most concerned question that software testing care about is in which subset 

we can find the most problem during all the possible testing. We can put the 

testing into three category: 

 White box testing: also named structure testing. This method regards 

testing software as white box. Based on the internal structure and logic, 

software is designed as testing sample to proceed a testing for the 

program’s path and process. White box’s main technique includes 

statement coverage, branch coverage, design coverage and elementary 

path coverage.  

 Black box testing: also named functional testing. This method sees testing 

software as black box. Without considering of internal structure and 



30 
 

characteristic to test software’s external’s characteristic, black box 

technique mainly includes equivalence class partition method, boundary 

value analysis, cause and effect diagram method, status mapping method, 

measurement method of outline and many typical malfunction model. 

 Gary box testing: This is the test between white and black box testing. Gray 

box testing mostly used on integrated test phase. It focus not only the validity 

of output and input, but also program’s internal condition. In addition, Gray 

box testing is not detailed and completed like white box testing, but focus 

more on internal logic than black box testing. It usually estimates the 

operational status through certificate of phenomenon, event and symbol. 

 

Team VeChain sets a special testing team and take on the role of “quality 

management”. The purpose is to make corrections in time and ensure the 

smoothly operation. Thus software testing is mainly for verification and 

confirmation. The target for software testing is not just program testing, but also 

includes all the documents from different phases of development, such as testing 

guidance book, testing project plan and testing report.  

  Testing guidance book: describing the testing requirements and theories 

  Testing project plan: describing testing sample and testing methods 

  Testing report: output testing results 

 

Testing is a process of convergence step by step and it strictly follows PDCA 

quality circle. The testing process from the description above is only one part of 

the PDCA. PDCA is acronym for Plan, Do, Check and Adjust. The PDCA 

circulation perform the quality check and it will keep going like this by using this 

order. 

 P (Plan) includes the confirmation of the testing plan that contains unit 

testing, integration testing, system testing (function, performance, safety 

and compatibility) and examine testing. 

 D (Do), based on the testing plan to perform the test. 

 C (Check), the final testing result and reflect the feedback to development 

team. 

 A (Adjust), development team improve and fix the original code based on 

the testing results. 

 

The goal of VeChain’s software testing: 

 Lower computer(PLC): Embedded software of IoT parts 

 Client: PC end, mobile end (ios, Android)and terminal software 

 Cloud 

 Server: software on Website and server  

 Blockchain part 

 Smart contract part 

 Interface part 

 



31 
 

For individual and interface between different parts on the four goals, we have 

professional testing team defining the testing guidance book, testing plan, and 

output result report. In addition we will use quality management methods by 

PDCA to complete the software testing and ensure the quality of VeChain’s 

product.  

 

This is part of the pressure test data result: 

 

 

Figure 2.6: Part of the pressure test data result. Testing environment is using the lowest cloud server 

configuration with different locations from global. The basic set up is single core 2G server. 

 

 

  2.7 Technology Development’s Path and Plan 

 

The development of VeChain technology has been through two years and the 

core of development focuses on three areas: application, standardization and 



32 
 

safety. VeChain team will keep following these three basic ideas to continue the 

development. 

  

VeChain technology team has three units: 

1) R&D – focus on the bottom level of the technology and development, as 

well as with the newest technology analysis and experiment. In addition, 

they will make plans for the next generation’s possible path and feasibility 

analysis. 

2) Development – Based on the result of R&D, to perform and complete the 

development and get the initial testing result. 

3) Testing, deployment and maintenance – Based on the development 

result, R&D need to improve and correct the test result as well as taking 

care of related deployment and maintenance. 

 

Below is the path of the VeChain technology development and future plans: 

 
Figure 2.7-1 Technology development path 



33 
 

 

Figure 2.7-2 Future technology development path 

 

 

 

  



34 
 

3. The Industrial Application and Expansion 

 

In the past two years, VeChain has gained great amount of experience from many 

different fields of the work and some clients are world famous firms. The figure 

below shows the application structure of the VeChain: 

 

Figure3-1 Industrial application structure 

 

Based on the bottom structure of Blockchain system, VeChain loaded a platform 

that is convenient to use for the business partner and a one-click deployment 

Blockchain Platform. Users only need to select the industry they are in and the 

solution plan they want, the system will allow the user to manage their own 

Blockchain nodes, smart contract and generate related API setting.  

 

Meanwhile, together, VeChain and cooperative partner are developing a third 

party application which is focused on Blockchain to serve VeChain’s customers. 

For instance, VeChain is developing a unique Blockchain audit service with a 

world famous accounting firm. It provides data auto-collection and audit 

suggestion on Blockchain overall operating states, smart contract status, 

business operation status.  

 



35 
 

 

 

Figure 3-2 Third party service application 

 

In addition, the application structure of VeChain also includes self-developed 

distributed encrypted database service- CHAOS, user private key management 

and smart contract authorization, etc. This modular service model makes 

customers and service provider’s development more convenient and flexible.   

 

VeChain plans to use these successful cases as template to expand and develop 

more quickly. VeChain wants to let more enterprise and business activities 

operate based on the VeChain platform. In addition, establishing the connection 

with these business activities step by step. At the same time, through developing 

related business smart contracts to promote the circulation of VeChain 

Token(VET) in order to complete and expand VeChain’s distributed business 

ecosystem step by step.  

 

  3.1 Fashion and Luxury Industry  

 

According to the survey from year 2015, it costs fashion and luxury brand of 

Europe 9.7% of the total sales every year, about 2.87 billion dollars, for anti-

counterfeiting. Due to the overrun by the fake goods, it costs Europe lost 363,000 

jobs in fashion, manufacturing and retail industry each year.  

 



36 
 

 
Figure 3.1-1 the impact of fake good to the Europe fashion industries 

 

VeChain aims to focus on this industries by following production management, 

production channels, anti-counterfeit and the connection with customers. The 

third party makes product based on the order plan and at the same time, the 

brand party can “activate” this product when verifying it. This is the process of 

Chain to verify the enterprise’s SAP order form and authorize the real thing from 

the beginning of the process.  

 

Meanwhile, VeChain establishes the data connection of WMS with the enterprise 

and complete the Blockchain process with dealers and retailers sales channel, in 

order to achieve the management to the sales channel. For the customers, 

VeChain provides a digital ownership to build a bridge between the brand and 

customers and keeping the transmitting to CRM and after-sales service. In order 

to establish a customized individual service, after-sales service and customer 

care for customers. It can even track the trends of the second-hand market. At 

the same time, the anonymous privacy protection feature of Blockchain perfectly 

fits the safety rule of EU’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). 

 

VeChain makes business with famous Europe luxury brand by putting IoT 

encrypted chips that is based on the Blockchain technology into product. As the 

medium of the data collecting for Blockchain, the chip records the every “logistics”, 

warehousing and transmission. After the customers get the product, they can 

scan the chip behind the tag through the APP and they can know the “history” of 

this product. So the customers can identify the authenticity of the products, and 

making a statement of the product’s digital ownership at the mobile end.  

 

 

  3.2 Food Safety 

 

Food safety directly affects people’s health. Since the budget of being healthy has 

growing all the time, both producers and customers would care a lot about food 

safety. However, traditional food safety relies too much on the process control and 



37 
 

entrepreneur’s sense of responsibility. So it is pretty hard to ensure the safety of 

food by using automated methods. It is quite difficult to track the original source if 

any problem occurred.  

 

Yet the Blockchain technology could bring safe and reliable solutions to the food 

industry. The Chinese government has already confirmed that food certification 

and tracking through supply chain are the key steps to find and eliminate the 

source of pollution in a very fast way.  

 

The Liquor tracking platform in Waigaoqiao free trade zone, which built by 

VeChain, can track the liquor product from the very beginning of the process, even 

when the liquor was still in the overseas winery. This is the first successful case 

in domestic. Every details about the bottle of red wine is marked and recorded at 

the beginning of the process. This way company can use smart contract to track 

the whole life period of the red wine, from the warehouse in the free trade zone 

to for the first time. From the distribution center and finally reach to each different 

sales channels and stores.  

 

Customers can identify and track the information of the wine through the in-store 

touch-screen or even customer’s own smart phone. High-end wine are also 

equipped with IoT Chips with the feature of safety and convenient. Customers 

can use their Cell phone to check these information as well which increases the 

security level.  

 

 

 



38 
 

 

Figure 3.2-1 VeChain application in the wine Free trade zone: background management system, smart 

front terminal, mobile showcase 

 

For the next part of the plan, we are going to let more oversea wineries and 

welcome more imported product providers to join into our platform, so customers 

can feel safe about the product. We are also going to open the connection and 

start the cooperation, let the customer see more information about the product.  

 

On the other hand, the product that VeChain is following right now is one of the 

most focal point product: dairy, dairy food safety is a hot topic that people pay 

huge attention to. The regulation requirement is stricter, especially when the news 

about domestic milk powder contains melamine and makes the milk powder toxic. 

Mengniu Cooper has to increase the breadth of the product sale and the multiple 

security check to ensure the source of the dairy product is safe. This is what they 

paid for the huge loss of customer trust. In 2007, Mengniu corporate spent 3.302 

billion Yuan in sales and distribution cost, and the number increased to 4.428 

billion Yuan in 2008. The advertise expense in sales percentage has increased 

by 2.1 percent to 9.3%. This is merely the cost for losing trust of one single 

enterprise. Although this event has passed for so long, the dairy industry is still 

paying for this. We can definitely make more example of this, it shows that the 

cost of trust is almost unbelievable.  

 

VeChain provides the standard adding Chain function that let all participants 

upload the data by using the permission to complete a Chain. (Like Figure Below) 

 

Figure 3.2-2 The process of Dairy industry and ID code 



39 
 

 

VeChain can help Dairy Company by providing farm information, including 

Fertilizers management, the audit for feed supplier, the healthy condition of the 

livestock and the drug use on the cow and environment report. This process 

ensures the food safety from the very beginning the milk source. VeChain can 

also help the production supplier to check the receiving time of the raw milk, the 

storage condition of the raw milk, production reference number, and the detail 

information of processing personnel and people who are responsible. In addition, 

Package storage can use the technology methods to tracking the temperature 

and humidity while transporting. Moreover, the production’s loading information of 

distribution center and data information can also supported by VeChain. Finally, 

owning these information cannot just prevent counterfeit product but it also 

increases the product supplier and customer’s faith for the industry. 

 

  3.3 Car Industry 

 

Industry Chain for the Car industry is very complicated. There are many 

participants, like manufacturer, different agents, regulator, financial service 

provider (Insurance, Bank) and personal account. In the life circle of a car, there 

are a big portion of the “user data” are never owned by customer, instead these 

data are separated in the pocket of different participants. This causes many 

difficulties of car information collection and verification. 

 

VeChain and Europe strategic partner Visco, Microsoft invent a verification idea 

for many international car enterprise together. In the project, VeChain team is 

responsible for completing the Blockchain deployment on Azure, developing and 

deploying smart contract and provide standard API to the upper level developers 

to complete the final product.  

 

Digital maintenance principle: Every car can build their own digital record and 

build the authorization of the ownership. After car owner bought the car, they can 

use authorization and non-authorization feature to give permission by the server 

maintenance suppliers. So every single maintenance data is recorded to the 

Blockchain. This way the data provided by different maintenance service provider 

can build the real grouping record step by step. For instance, insurance, bank and 

other financial service provider can provide fast insurance and value assessment 

based on the data supplied by this trustworthy network. The operating expense 

that saved by this can be returned to the car owner.  

 

“Green Driving”: Green driving is the shared electronmobile project provided by 

this car enterprise. Every customers can record related driving records by internal 

computer in car and upload them to the Blockchain and connect the data together 

which owned. In the future, these data can proves the beneficial information of 

the certain project like “carbon emission” and even customer data can be used as 



40 
 

individual creditability.

  3.4 Supply Chain Industry 

 

Traditional supply Chain includes: original material supplier, manufacturer, agent, 

logistics, customs inspection agency, storage, retail and finally customers.  

 

 

Figure 3.4-1 Traditional supply chain 

 

 Traditional supply chain industry is facing many problems includes: 

1) It is quite difficult to track supply chain since its cross-region   

2) It lacks of transparency between different supply chain and information  

3) Data security vulnerability in different enterprise of supply chain  

4) Money flow transport has bad timeliness 



41 
 

VeChain provides Baas (Blockchain-as-a-service) service to one of the biggest   

freight forwarders K+N to track and manage all the products from many world’s 

famous brand. To ensure the data protection and privacy as the precondition, 

VeChain completed the connection with different customers through a common 

service platform. The operation staff can complete related business work by 

directly using the handheld terminals.  

    

 

   

 

Figure3.4-2 The showcase of logistics issue solution by the famous freight forwarders 

 

In the late period of the plan we are going to make connection with more related 

cooperative partners, service provider and regulators.  

 

  3.5 The Agricultural Industry 

 

The Chinese market is facing many critical issues like the scale of the agriculture 



42 
 

which is too small and separated, the quality of the product is uneven, the lack of 

the safety level of the product, low productivity and environment pollution. It is 

quite hard to fix the issue completely by simply using a certain technology from 

the internet or a law regulation provided by the government. We can only change 

the thinking model by using the technology like the special Blockchain cloud 

project that is exclusive for the verification of the green organic agricultural in 

order to use industrial management to build modern agricultural. 

 

China is promoting Agricultural Cultivation Management Plan by using IoT 

technology, agricultural planting process management, the Blockchain technology, 

big data and AI (artificial smart) to complete the management of the process 

before, in the middle and after the agricultural production. In this way, good 

currency drives out the bad currency to achieve standard agricultural market. 

 

With this background, VeChain is cooperating with PwC, China Unicom and 

Liaoning academy of agricultural sciences to develop the special Blockchain 

cloud project that is exclusive for the verification of the green organic agricultural.  

 

In this project, VeChain has registered the greenhouse for every farm by using 

the Blockchain tech to build a data model to record the functional data of every 

greenhouse. Data source has two main parts: the first part is the production 

operation data which recorded by the famers directly; and the second part of the 

data comes from the IoT sensor in the greenhouse. Based on the combination of 

the data and risk assurance service from PwC, it will establish the foundation of 

the trustworthy data for the green agricultural verification by the academy of 

agricultural sciences. In addition, with the support by the IoT equipment, it 

improves the efficiency of the farm work by about 9 times. 

 

 

Figure 3.5 Application of agriculture combines with IoT technology 

  

  3.6 Blockchain Government Affairs 

 

Government agency shows interest in the Blockchain technology. China ministry 



43 
 

of industry and information technology has released a white paper about the 

application and development of the Blockchain technology. The State Council 

underlined that Blockchain can bring a world with trust. 

 

The science office of British government has reported the potential qualities and 

advantage of Blockchain technology in the recent report: “Distributed ledger 

technology has the potential to transform the delivery of public and private 

services. It has the potential to redefine the relationship between government and 

the citizen in terms of data sharing, transparency and trust and make a leading 

contribution to the government’s digital transformation plan.” 

 

VeChain has signed strategic cooperation agreement with local government with 

big data collection to build case project for Blockchain Government affairs. 

VeChain has a targeted plan in some very typical application area of the 

Blockchain technology. 

 

For instance, commodity inspection is always reported by manpower to the 

inspection agency, then agency will inform the client for the material of random 

sample. Because of the system that agency use is so different than the others, 

also agency and client are only using manpower to report and delivery every 

information transaction. This may cause the unmatched information, very long 

process, low efficiency, and even the risk of data manipulation.   

 

 

Figure 3.6-1 Blockchain Government application 

 

VeChain will share related data on the Blockchain platform, agent and the client 

both can check the random sample date through VeChain’s APP. This makes the 

whole process paperless and complete the connection between Blockchain ID 

and waybill number, data ID and waybill number, then finally smart contract ID 



44 
 

and the related operation function. The goal is to reduce the paper use from 20-

30 pages to 2-3 pages per file. This will increase the efficiency by 80%.  

 

 

     

 

Figure-3.6-2 Blockchain Government Application 

 

The Blockchain technology has shown significant meaning to the government. It 

represents the quality of government of open, public and transparent about the 

information. At the same time, as the “coordinator” of the whole commercial 

environment, government focus more on how Blockchain can improve the 

efficiency of the resource distribution in different industries.  

 

  3.7 This is just the Beginning 

 

In the past two years, team VeChain has faced many big challenged. It’s not the 

technical consensus, but the consensus of how to achieve the business model 

and change from the traditional business. However, we have been through the 

worst part already, and we thank so much for the cooperation partners and 

customers who dared to step into this field with us, so we can develop and verify 

the practical use of the Blockchain.  

 

VeChain ICO is not just a beginning, because we have the experience from the 



45 
 

past two years. VeChain ICO is also a beginning because in front us, we still have 

a long way to go in this business environment. The challenge is we still need to 

invent new business model and promote them in order to complete building the 

thoroughly connection within the team VeChain, enterprise participant and 

community.  

4. Governance Structure and Management Philosophy 

 

In the beginning of the discussion about ICO and the preparation for the later 

stage, VeChain team has many heated debates and a long night talk, but we 

always have a consistent pint of view: 

 

"ICO is the beginning of everything, not the end of everything. All the so-called 

‘successful’ ICO, in fact, is only a good starting power. And when the ICO stops, 

then it’s really the time for the beginning of everything. The main theme is always 

about how to speed up, how to run on the right track, and how to avoid ‘dying’ 

during the process. Meanwhile, the team cannot just celebrate because of the 

ICO initial funding, but this should be regarded as the team bearing the hope of 

the community/business world and proceeding with great cautions. “ 

 

Therefore, maintaining the sustainable development of a team is also a 

proposition that the VeChain team has been discussing and thinking.  

 

The corporate governance structure from the company system, is used to 

constrain the enterprise strategy, risk management, operation principle, human 

resources and legal compliance program. 

 

Although the Blockchain technology utilizes decentralized concept as the starting 

point and establishes an efficient collaborative community platform, in order to 

improve the efficiency of collaborative Blockchain community and its operation, 

the team can still learn from the experience of corporate governance structure. 

The VeChain is also a framework of "non-traditional" community. In addition to 

the individual participants, there are more business users from different enterprise 

would agree to a reasonable corporate governance structure. 

 

Of course, the structure concept cannot be applied mechanically. It is necessary 

to seek a dynamic balance between community culture and traditional enterprise 

management culture. This treatment method is combined based on our 

experience in the Blockchain industry during the past few years with the constant 

adjusting and optimizing in the future development.  

 



46 
 

4.1 The Establishment of VeChain Foundation  

 

The VeChain Foundation (will refer as the Foundation hereinafter) is a non - profit 

entity established in Singapore in July 2017. The foundation will act as VeChain 

sponsor entity, who committed to support VeChain’s development, construction 

and governance, transparency, advocacy and promotion work, as well as 

promoting the safety and harmonious development of the community. 

 

The standard Blockchain community aims at a high degree of autonomy or 

decentralized as goal, allowing community participants to diversify their decision-

making advice and usually use “vote” on important matters. However, such 

behavior is inefficient or unresolved because of the diversity of participants' 

opinions, which is not conducive to the continuous iteration and evolution of the 

Blockchain technology.  

 

Moreover, because of the bifurcation behavior of the Blockchain, it causes serious 

divergence of opinion. The solution of "hard forking" has made people question 

the idea of "de-centering" of” Ethereum” and even "Blockchain". This way of 

governance is not so much a "democracy" but an "anarchy."  

 

VeChain development team highly recognized Blockchain’s “decentralized” as 

the construction of the essence, while absorbing the essence of the traditional 

corporate governance structure, and improving the efficient formulation and 

implementation of the VeChain development strategy. At the same time it also 

prevent the serious Blockchain design philosophy differences and irreconcilable 

issue from showing up again.  

 

The VeChain team commissioned a trusted third party organization to assist the 

team in setting up foundation entities in Singapore and to maintain the day-to-day 

operations as well as reporting the entity architecture. After establishing the 

Foundation, it selects the appropriate members of the community to join the 

functional Committee of the Foundation to participate in the actual management 

and decision-making. 

 

4.2．Governance Principle 

 

The design objective of the VeChain Foundation governance structure mainly 

focused on the sustainability of VeChain platform, the effectiveness of the 

strategy formulation, the management effectiveness, the risk control and the 

efficient operation of the platform economy. 

 

1) The combination of centralized governance and distributed 

architecture 



47 
 

Although there are arguments advocating that Blockchain is a de-centralized 

or distributed self-governance community system. We believe that the 

absolute de-centralized may bring the absolute "fairness" but more likely to be 

further “inefficient". Therefore, the core idea of the Foundation is to absorb the 

concept of in the management structure of central governance, including the 

highest decision-making authority strategic Committee and major issues of the 

centralized procedure to improve the efficiency of the whole operation of the 

community.  

 

2) The function of Committee and functional units coexist 

The function of Committee and functional units coexist in the Foundation for 

daily affairs, which will set up permanent functional units, such as R & D 

department, marketing department, operation department, financial and 

human resources departments to handle daily affairs. 

At the same time, a functional Committee is set up to make decisions on the 

important functions of the Foundation. Unlike the functional units, functional 

Committees exist in a virtual architecture where members of the Committee 

can be from any place of the world and do not have to work full-time. However, 

it must meet the requirements of the Committee's expert qualifications and be 

able to undertake to present and make comments when the Committee is 

required to present. The functional Committee will also set up a regular 

meeting system to ensure the effective promotion of major decision-making 

matters. 

 

3) Risk oriented governance principles 

The risk management will be the most important element in the process of 

studying the strategic development of VeChain Foundation. As a computer 

technology with great on-going revolutionary, the development of Blockchain 

is still in its infancy, so it is very important to grasp its development trend. The 

principle of risk management, when making sure the Foundation makes 

important decisions, takes full account of the risk factors, the possibility and 

influence of its occurrence, and makes corresponding countermeasures 

through decision-making. Thus, the development and iteration of the 

Blockchain is on the right path.  

 

4) Technology and Commerce Coexisting 

Any technology that is divorced from commercial applications is often difficult 

to develop. If the technology lack the practical function, it will stop and even 

come to the end. 

From the creation of the VeChain, it always adhere to the close integration with 

the business as its purpose. The VeChain Foundation also follows this 

objective. Even if the Foundation will present as a non-profit organization, but 

the Foundation wants to get the maximum possible recognition of the business 

world. To get the business application of revenue, feedback to the Foundation 



48 
 

and the community, while further promoting the Foundation as well as the 

VeChain’s development and upgrade. The VeChain Foundation also takes full 

account of this principle in the selection of talent and its architecture. It focuses 

on attracting experts with technical expertise, including industry experts who 

have a deep understanding of business. 

 

5). Transparency and supervision 

Referring to the governance experience of the traditional commercial world, 

VeChain Foundation also intends to set up special monitoring and reporting 

channels (Whistle-Blower). Designated by the strategic decision Committee 

as a window and we welcome the community participants to join in the 

management, supervision and the operation of Whistle-Blower channel. Those 

include, but are not limited to, new breakthroughs or recommendations that 

have significant implications for the Foundation or the Blockchain technologies, 

community operations issues, crisis information and fraud reporting or fraud, 

etc. 

The Foundation will publish a unified information collection window, while 

ensuring the privacy of the information collected. At the same time, the 

Foundation publish periodic reports and irregular news releases in the form of 

community participation in all parties to disclose the Foundation operation and 

development of VeChain. Meanwhile, the main contacts of the Foundation 

management will be fully open, and accept the supervision and liaison of the 

participants. 

 

4.3 VeChain Governance Model 

 

The organizational structure of VeChain Foundation raised a combination of 

Specialized Committee and functional departments, which will deal with daily 

work and special matters. This section will discuss the functions of the 

functional Committees of the Foundation as well as the functions of the major 

functional departments.  

 

With the reference to the operation of traditional entities, the Foundation will 

set up functional Committees, including the strategic decision-making 

Committee, the technical audit Committee, the remuneration and Nomination 

Committee and the public relations Committee.

The functional departments maintain the normal operation of the VeChain 

Foundation, and directly deal with the relevant parties in the commercial society, 

such as enterprise customers, suppliers, regulators and the three party service 

organizations. 

 

4.4 VeChain Human Resource Management 

 

VeChain is committed to creating the world's most influential open source 

community ecology. To ensure the smooth development of the technology and 

the continuity of the Foundation operation, the Foundation will focus on recruiting 

excellent technology developers and managers with deep understandings of the 

business. 

 

Talent Recruitment  

Based on the characteristics of "Blockchain without borders", the Foundation 



52 
 

welcome talented people from all over the world to join the Foundation. In 

addition to the individual posts that must be recruited locally (e.g., logistics 

managers), recruitment is not limited to the place of work or the form of work. 

VeChain Foundation will, at the same time, follow the best practices in human 

resource management, develop appropriate human resources plans, 

recruitment procedures and review procedures to ensure that Foundations 

attract the right people.

4.5 Risk Assessment and Decision Making Mechanism of VeChain Foundation 

 

As an innovative technology, Blockchain is not only a disruptive breakthrough in 

computer core technology, but also a challenge to the traditional commercial 

society. Therefore, the importance of risk management system is self-evident. 

The VeChain Foundation is committed to build a risk oriented sustainable chain 

of block communities. It will continue to operate risk management of the 

foundation which includes the establishment of risk system, risk assessment, risk 

response and a series of activities. 

 

For major risks, the strategic decision Committee will discuss and make decisions. 

It will classify risks based on event characteristics, such as event impact, extent 

of impact, probability of tokens and probability of occurrence, and decisions based 

on priority. For priority events, the relevant Committees of the foundation shall be 

organized as soon as possible. 

 

4.6 VeChain Foundation Economy 

 

In its economic operations, the Foundation promotes the following major 

principles: 

1) Take the nonprofit as the main principle, and give back to the community; 

2) Sustainable development  

3) Collaboration and sharing of resources 

 



53 
 

Financially, the Foundation will seek the financial balance between expanding 

and community development. In addition to the initial funding received during the 

ICO, the Foundation will be able to obtain digital asset income through community 

eco operations. Under the arrangement of the third party trust institution, it will be 

transparent to distribute all the benefits to all operations and community 

development.  

 

The Foundation will set up a full-time financial management team to maintain its 

financial and digital assets. The financial management team reports directly to 

the strategic decision Committee, and regularly prepare the financial reports and 

disclosures of the Foundation. 

 

4.6.1 Funding Sources  

 

The main income of the Foundation can be divided into two areas:  

1)  Non-operating income comprising the initial ICO's funds and the return on 

digital assets. 

2)  Regular operating income, including R & D, product sales, patent transfer 

or licensing, academic exchange and contribution, etc.  

 

The following is a detailed description of the main sources of income: 

 

a. ICO initial startup funds.

Blockchain industry, such as start-ups and incubators, angel investment 

in emerging scientific and technological investment. 

c. In the process of building the ecosystem, VeChain will serve as an 

underlying architectures provider of VeChain and receive a certain amount 

of digital assets or funds. For example, community participants, 

enterprises and other VeChain Token(VET) purchasers for GAS, as well 

as the Foundation. It will provide technical sharing and licensing gains. 

For this part of the proceeds, the Foundation will continue to invest in the 

community, form a community constantly expanding, and increase the 

positive cycle of influence. 

 

4.6.2 Fund Budgeting  

 

As mentioned above, the Foundation's funds spending mainly includes day-to-

day operations, technology development, business development and 

reinvestment. The main categories are shown in the following table:

Figure 4.6.2-1 VeChain Foundation's 4 annual revenue forecast (000 RMB) 

 

Figure 4.6.2-1 VeChain Foundation 4 year cost forecast (000 RMB) 

 



56 
 

 

Figure 4.6.2-1 the VeChain Foundation's 4 year retained earnings forecast (000 RMB) 

 

To sum up, the VeChain Foundation is expected to obtain start-up funds through 

ICO activities, which took about 3-4 years to achieve: 

 

1) Foundation scale and influence continues to grow. This includes 

headcounts increasing to around 100. The Foundation attracted the 

business world continuously joining with than 150 billion yuan of goods 

in the VeChain flow. 

2) Foundation completes the self-circulation. The Foundation relies on 

initial ICO start-up funds to get commercial value from the community 

and feed back to the community. The Foundation guarantees that the 

gains will be balanced with the expenditure. 

3) Focusing on R & D and commercial promotion. According to the 

Foundation and VeChain concept, Foundation has always attached 

importance to the Blockchain based research and development, and 

business promotion and expand the influence. Most of the annual 

expenditure will focus on these two aspects. 

4) Adhere to the nonprofit principle. The Foundation promises not to 

distribute profits, nor does it call dividends". Foundation operating 

income, in addition to the basic expenditure of the foundation, will all be 

put into the expansion of the community, to promote the community 

growing. 

 

4.6.3 Fund Use Restriction 

 

The use of VeChain assets is in line with the principles of openness and 

transparency. According to the principle of distribution and budget, VeChain will 

set up a separate account and digital asset wallet address used by depository 



57 
 

institutions to digital assets supervision and regularly share to the community. The 

principle of the use of revenue from public sale: 

  Exceeding the value of 1 million yuan (or equivalent digital assets) 

requires approval by the head of the financial unit and the Secretary 

General. 

   Over 5 million yuan (or equivalent digital assets) will need to be 

approved by the policy-making Committee. 

 

4.6.4 Financial Planning and Implementation Reports 

 

Each quarter, the financial and personnel management Committee prepare the 

financial planning, and summarize the last quarter financial performance. The 

formation of financial reports will be submitted to the decision-making Committee 

for approval. 

 

4.6.5 Digital Asset Management 

 

The digital assets belonging to the Foundation are appointed by the strategic 

decision Committee, and the full-time financial personnel are responsible for the 

arrangement. Digital assets and transaction currency are arranged independently 

and timely financial accounting. Following the best practices of financial control, 

the Foundation adopts multiple signatures to ensure the safety and accuracy of 

the assets. All the collected coins will be the timely transfer to digital assets and 

digital wallet. Foundation assets are not deposited in individual accounts. 

 

 

  Digital wallet management  

Based on the principle of independence, VeChain Foundation's wallet adopts 

4/7 multi signature. Added Signature is subject to the approval of the strategic 

decision Committee. Large tokens is cold saved, and small tokens use multiple 

signatures. 

 

  Disclosure matters 

Each year, the Foundation will inform the community of chain development, 

operations, business promotion and the Foundation's operations. For the 

financial situation of the Foundation, the financial statements will be performed 

quarterly, and the work of the annual audit will be disclosed as well. 

The Foundation establishes a public relations Committee, which serves as an 

external window for regular and irregular meetings and releases important 

information to the public. 

 

4.7 Legal Compliance Matters and Other Matters  

 

  Legal affairs 



58 
 

VeChain team commissioned a trusted third party organization to set up a 

Foundation entity in Singapore. All operations are subject to local laws, 

regulations and regulatory requirements. If there is a need to seek legal advice, 

it needs to be confirmed by local counsel.
