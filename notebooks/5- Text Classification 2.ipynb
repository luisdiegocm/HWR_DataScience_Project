Introduction to Bitcoin and Existing Concepts\\n\\ni. History\\nThe concept of decentralized digital currency, as well as alternative \\napplications like property registries, has been around for decades. \\nThe anonymous e-cash protocols of the 1980s and the 1990s, \\nmostly reliant on a cryptographic primitive known as Chaumian \\nblinding, provided a currency with a high degree of privacy, but the \\nprotocols largely failed to gain traction because of their reliance on \\na centralized intermediary. In 1998, Wei Dai\\'s [b-money](http://\\nwww.weidai.com/bmoney.txt) became the first proposal to introduce \\nthe idea of creating money through solving computational puzzles \\nas well as decentralized consensus, but the proposal was scant on \\ndetails as to how decentralized consensus could actually be \\nimplemented. In 2005, Hal Finney introduced a concept of \\n[reusable](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/), a system \\nwhich uses ideas from b-money together with Adam Back\\'s \\ncomputationally difficult Hashcash puzzles to create a concept for a \\ncryptocurrency, but once again fell short of the ideal by relying on \\ntrusted computing as a backend. In 2009, a decentralized currency \\nwas for the first time implemented in practice by Satoshi Nakamoto, \\ncombining established primitives for managing ownership through \\npublic key cryptography with a consensus algorithm for keeping \\ntrack of who owns coins, known as \"proof of work\".\\nThe mechanism behind proof of work was a breakthrough in the \\nspace because it simultaneously solved two problems. First, it \\nprovided a simple and moderately effective consensus algorithm, \\nallowing nodes in the network to collectively agree on a set of \\ncanonical updates to the state of the Bitcoin ledger. Second, it \\nprovided a mechanism for allowing free entry into the consensus \\n\\nhttp://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt\\nhttp://www.weidai.com/bmoney.txt\\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/finney/rpow/\\n\\n\\nprocess, solving the political problem of deciding who gets to \\ninfluence the consensus, while simultaneously preventing sybil \\nattacks. It does this by substituting a formal barrier to participation, \\nsuch as the requirement to be registered as a unique entity on a \\nparticular list, with an economic barrier - the weight of a single node \\nin the consensus voting process is directly proportional to the \\ncomputing power that the node brings. Since then, an alternative \\napproach has been proposed called _proof of stake_, calculating \\nthe weight of a node as being proportional to its currency holdings \\nand not computational resources; the discussion of the relative \\nmerits of the two approaches is beyond the scope of this paper but \\nit should be noted that both approaches can be used to serve as \\nthe backbone of a cryptocurrency.\\n\\nHere is a blog post from Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, on \\n[Ethereum](https://vitalik.ca/2017-09-15-prehistory.html). [Here]\\n(https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-\\ndream/) is another blog post with more history.\\n\\ni. Bitcoin As A State Transition System\\n![statetransition.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\\nethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/\\nstatetransition.png)\\nFrom a technical standpoint, the ledger of a cryptocurrency such as \\nBitcoin can be thought of as a state transition system, where there \\nis a \"state\" consisting of the ownership status of all existing bitcoins \\nand a \"state transition function\" that takes a state and a transaction \\nand outputs a new state which is the result. In a standard banking \\nsystem, for example, the state is a balance sheet, a transaction is a \\nrequest to move $X from A to B, and the state transition function \\nreduces the value in A\\'s account by $X and increases the value in \\nB\\'s account by $X. If A\\'s account has less than $X in the first place, \\nthe state transition function returns an error. Hence, one can \\nformally define:\\n\\n    APPLY(S,TX) -> S\\' or ERROR \\nIn the banking system defined above:\\n\\nhttps://vitalik.ca/2017-09-15-prehistory.html\\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/\\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/\\nhttps://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/09/cut-and-try-building-a-dream/\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/statetransition.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/statetransition.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/statetransition.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/statetransition.png\\n\\n\\n    APPLY({ Alice: $50, Bob: $50 },\"send $20 from Alice to \\nBob\") = { Alice: $30, Bob: $70 } \\nBut:\\n\\n    APPLY({ Alice: $50, Bob: $50 },\"send $70 from Alice to \\nBob\") = ERROR \\nThe \"state\" in Bitcoin is the collection of all coins (technically, \\n\"unspent transaction outputs\" or UTXO) that have been mined and \\nnot yet spent, with each UTXO having a denomination and an \\nowner (defined by a 20-byte address which is essentially a \\ncryptographic public key[fn.](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-\\nPaper#notes)). A transaction contains one or more inputs, with each \\ninput containing a reference to an existing UTXO and a \\ncryptographic signature produced by the private key associated with \\nthe owner\\'s address, and one or more outputs, with each output \\ncontaining a new UTXO to be added to the state.\\n\\nThe state transition function `APPLY(S,TX) -> S\\'` can be defined \\nroughly as follows:\\n\\n1. For each input in `TX`:\\n\\n    * If the referenced UTXO is not in `S`, return an \\nerror. \\n    * If the provided signature does not match the owner \\nof the UTXO, return an error. \\n2. If the sum of the denominations of all input UTXO is less than the \\nsum of the denominations of all output UTXO, return an error. 3. \\nReturn `S\\'` with all input UTXO removed and all output UTXO \\nadded.\\n\\nThe first half of the first step prevents transaction senders from \\nspending coins that do not exist, the second half of the first step \\nprevents transaction senders from spending other people\\'s coins, \\nand the second step enforces conservation of value. In order to use \\nthis for payment, the protocol is as follows. Suppose Alice wants to \\nsend 11.7 BTC to Bob. First, Alice will look for a set of available \\nUTXO that she owns that totals up to at least 11.7 BTC. \\nRealistically, Alice will not be able to get exactly 11.7 BTC; say that \\n\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\n\\n\\nthe smallest she can get is 6+4+2=12. She then creates a \\ntransaction with those three inputs and two outputs. The first output \\nwill be 11.7 BTC with Bob\\'s address as its owner, and the second \\noutput will be the remaining 0.3 BTC \"change\", with the owner being \\nAlice herself.\\n\\ni. Mining\\n![block_picture.jpg](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\\nethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/block.png)\\nIf we had access to a trustworthy centralized service, this system \\nwould be trivial to implement; it could simply be coded exactly as \\ndescribed, using a centralized server\\'s hard drive to keep track of \\nthe state. However, with Bitcoin we are trying to build a \\ndecentralized currency system, so we will need to combine the \\nstate transition system with a consensus system in order to ensure \\nthat everyone agrees on the order of transactions. Bitcoin\\'s \\ndecentralized consensus process requires nodes in the network to \\ncontinuously attempt to produce packages of transactions called \\n\"blocks\". The network is intended to produce roughly one block \\nevery ten minutes, with each block containing a timestamp, a \\nnonce, a reference to (ie. hash of) the previous block and a list of all \\nof the transactions that have taken place since the previous block. \\nOver time, this creates a persistent, ever-growing, \"blockchain\" that \\nconstantly updates to represent the latest state of the Bitcoin ledger.\\n\\nThe algorithm for checking if a block is valid, expressed in this \\nparadigm, is as follows:\\n\\n1. Check if the previous block referenced by the block exists and is \\nvalid. 2. Check that the timestamp of the block is greater than that \\nof the previous block[fn.](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-\\nPaper#notes)\\xa0and less than 2 hours into the future 3. Check that the \\nproof of work on the block is valid. 4. Let `S[0]` be the state at the \\nend of the previous block. 5. Suppose `TX` is the block\\'s transaction \\nlist with `n` transactions. For all `i` in `0...n-1`, set `S[i+1] = \\nAPPLY(S[i],TX[i])` If any application returns an error, exit and return \\nfalse. 6. Return true, and register `S[n]` as the state at the end of \\nthis block.\\n\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/block.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/block.png\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\n\\n\\nEssentially, each transaction in the block must provide a valid state \\ntransition from what was the canonical state before the transaction \\nwas executed to some new state. Note that the state is not encoded \\nin the block in any way; it is purely an abstraction to be \\nremembered by the validating node and can only be (securely) \\ncomputed for any block by starting from the genesis state and \\nsequentially applying every transaction in every block. Additionally, \\nnote that the order in which the miner includes transactions into the \\nblock matters; if there are two transactions A and B in a block such \\nthat B spends a UTXO created by A, then the block will be valid if A \\ncomes before B but not otherwise.\\n\\nThe one validity condition present in the above list that is not found \\nin other systems is the requirement for \"proof of work\". The precise \\ncondition is that the double-SHA256 hash of every block, treated as \\na 256-bit number, must be less than a dynamically adjusted target, \\nwhich as of the time of this writing is approximately 2187. The \\npurpose of this is to make block creation computationally \"hard\", \\nthereby preventing sybil attackers from remaking the entire \\nblockchain in their favor. Because SHA256 is designed to be a \\ncompletely unpredictable pseudorandom function, the only way to \\ncreate a valid block is simply trial and error, repeatedly incrementing \\nthe nonce and seeing if the new hash matches.\\n\\nAt the current target of ~2187, the network must make an average of \\n~269\\xa0tries before a valid block is found; in general, the target is \\nrecalibrated by the network every 2016 blocks so that on average a \\nnew block is produced by some node in the network every ten \\nminutes. In order to compensate miners for this computational work, \\nthe miner of every block is entitled to include a transaction giving \\nthemselves 12.5 BTC out of nowhere. Additionally, if any transaction \\nhas a higher total denomination in its inputs than in its outputs, the \\ndifference also goes to the miner as a \"transaction fee\". Incidentally, \\nthis is also the only mechanism by which BTC are issued; the \\ngenesis state contained no coins at all.\\n\\nIn order to better understand the purpose of mining, let us examine \\nwhat happens in the event of a malicious attacker. Since Bitcoin\\'s \\n\\n\\n\\nunderlying cryptography is known to be secure, the attacker will \\ntarget the one part of the Bitcoin system that is not protected by \\ncryptography directly: the order of transactions. The attacker\\'s \\nstrategy is simple:\\n\\n1. Send 100 BTC to a merchant in exchange for some product \\n(preferably a rapid-delivery digital good) 2. Wait for the delivery of \\nthe product 3. Produce another transaction sending the same 100 \\nBTC to himself 4. Try to convince the network that his transaction to \\nhimself was the one that came first.\\n\\nOnce step (1) has taken place, after a few minutes some miner will \\ninclude the transaction in a block, say block number 270. After \\nabout one hour, five more blocks will have been added to the chain \\nafter that block, with each of those blocks indirectly pointing to the \\ntransaction and thus \"confirming\" it. At this point, the merchant will \\naccept the payment as finalized and deliver the product; since we \\nare assuming this is a digital good, delivery is instant. Now, the \\nattacker creates another transaction sending the 100 BTC to \\nhimself. If the attacker simply releases it into the wild, the \\ntransaction will not be processed; miners will attempt to run \\n`APPLY(S,TX)` and notice that `TX` consumes a UTXO which is no \\nlonger in the state. So instead, the attacker creates a \"fork\" of the \\nblockchain, starting by mining another version of block 270 pointing \\nto the same block 269 as a parent but with the new transaction in \\nplace of the old one. Because the block data is different, this \\nrequires redoing the proof of work. Furthermore, the attacker\\'s new \\nversion of block 270 has a different hash, so the original blocks 271 \\nto 275 do not \"point\" to it; thus, the original chain and the attacker\\'s \\nnew chain are completely separate. The rule is that in a fork the \\nlongest blockchain is taken to be the truth, and so legitimate miners \\nwill work on the 275 chain while the attacker alone is working on the \\n270 chain. In order for the attacker to make his blockchain the \\nlongest, he would need to have more computational power than the \\nrest of the network combined in order to catch up (hence, \"51% \\nattack\").\\n\\ni. Merkle Trees\\n\\n\\n\\n![SPV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/www/master-\\npostsale/src/extras/gh_wiki/spv_bitcoin.png)\\n_Left: it suffices to present only a small number of nodes in a \\nMerkle tree to give a proof of the validity of a branch._\\n\\n_Right: any attempt to change any part of the Merkle tree will \\neventually lead to an inconsistency somewhere up the chain._\\n\\nAn important scalability feature of Bitcoin is that the block is stored \\nin a multi-level data structure. The \"hash\" of a block is actually only \\nthe hash of the block header, a roughly 200-byte piece of data that \\ncontains the timestamp, nonce, previous block hash and the root \\nhash of a data structure called the Merkle tree storing all \\ntransactions in the block. A Merkle tree is a type of binary tree, \\ncomposed of a set of nodes with a large number of leaf nodes at \\nthe bottom of the tree containing the underlying data, a set of \\nintermediate nodes where each node is the hash of its two children, \\nand finally a single root node, also formed from the hash of its two \\nchildren, representing the \"top\" of the tree. The purpose of the \\nMerkle tree is to allow the data in a block to be delivered piecemeal: \\na node can download only the header of a block from one source, \\nthe small part of the tree relevant to them from another source, and \\nstill be assured that all of the data is correct. The reason why this \\nworks is that hashes propagate upward: if a malicious user attempts \\nto swap in a fake transaction into the bottom of a Merkle tree, this \\nchange will cause a change in the node above, and then a change \\nin the node above that, finally changing the root of the tree and \\ntherefore the hash of the block, causing the protocol to register it as \\na completely different block (almost certainly with an invalid proof of \\nwork).\\n\\nThe Merkle tree protocol is arguably essential to long-term \\nsustainability. A \"full node\" in the Bitcoin network, one that stores \\nand processes the entirety of every block, takes up about 15 GB of \\ndisk space in the Bitcoin network as of April 2014, and is growing by \\nover a gigabyte per month. Currently, this is viable for some desktop \\ncomputers and not phones, and later on in the future only \\nbusinesses and hobbyists will be able to participate. A protocol \\n\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/www/master-postsale/src/extras/gh_wiki/spv_bitcoin.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/www/master-postsale/src/extras/gh_wiki/spv_bitcoin.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/www/master-postsale/src/extras/gh_wiki/spv_bitcoin.png\\n\\n\\nknown as \"simplified payment verification\" (SPV) allows for another \\nclass of nodes to exist, called \"light nodes\", which download the \\nblock headers, verify the proof of work on the block headers, and \\nthen download only the \"branches\" associated with transactions that \\nare relevant to them. This allows light nodes to determine with a \\nstrong guarantee of security what the status of any Bitcoin \\ntransaction, and their current balance, is while downloading only a \\nvery small portion of the entire blockchain.\\n\\ni. Alternative Blockchain Applications\\nThe idea of taking the underlying blockchain idea and applying it to \\nother concepts also has a long history. In 1998, Nick Szabo came \\nout with the concept of [secure](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-\\nproperty-titles/), a document describing how \"new advances in \\nreplicated database technology\" will allow for a blockchain-based \\nsystem for storing a registry of who owns what land, creating an \\nelaborate framework including concepts such as homesteading, \\nadverse possession and Georgian land tax. However, there was \\nunfortunately no effective replicated database system available at \\nthe time, and so the protocol was never implemented in practice. \\nAfter 2009, however, once Bitcoin\\'s decentralized consensus was \\ndeveloped a number of alternative applications rapidly began to \\nemerge.\\nâ€¢ **Namecoin** - created in 2010, [Namecoin](https://\\n\\nnamecoin.org/) is best described as a decentralized name \\nregistration database. In decentralized protocols like Tor, \\nBitcoin and BitMessage, there needs to be some way of \\nidentifying accounts so that other people can interact with \\nthem, but in all existing solutions the only kind of identifier \\navailable is a pseudorandom hash like \\n`1LW79wp5ZBqaHW1jL5TCiBCrhQYtHagUWy`. Ideally, one \\nwould like to be able to have an account with a name like \\n\"george\". However, the problem is that if one person can \\ncreate an account named \"george\" then someone else can \\nuse the same process to register \"george\" for themselves as \\nwell and impersonate them. The only solution is a first-to-file \\nparadigm, where the first registerer succeeds and the second \\nfails - a problem perfectly suited for the Bitcoin consensus \\n\\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/\\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/secure-property-titles/\\nhttps://namecoin.org/\\nhttps://namecoin.org/\\n\\n\\nprotocol. Namecoin is the oldest, and most successful, \\nimplementation of a name registration system using such an \\nidea.\\n\\nâ€¢ **Colored coins** - the purpose of [colored](https://\\ndocs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/\\n1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/\\nedit) is to serve as a protocol to allow people to create their \\nown digital currencies - or, in the important trivial case of a \\ncurrency with one unit, digital tokens, on the Bitcoin \\nblockchain. In the colored coins protocol, one \"issues\" a new \\ncurrency by publicly assigning a color to a specific Bitcoin \\nUTXO, and the protocol recursively defines the color of other \\nUTXO to be the same as the color of the inputs that the \\ntransaction creating them spent (some special rules apply in \\nthe case of mixed-color inputs). This allows users to maintain \\nwallets containing only UTXO of a specific color and send \\nthem around much like regular bitcoins, backtracking through \\nthe blockchain to determine the color of any UTXO that they \\nreceive.\\n\\nâ€¢ **Metacoins** - the idea behind a metacoin is to have a \\nprotocol that lives on top of Bitcoin, using Bitcoin transactions \\nto store metacoin transactions but having a different state \\ntransition function, `APPLY\\'`. Because the metacoin protocol \\ncannot prevent invalid metacoin transactions from appearing in \\nthe Bitcoin blockchain, a rule is added that if `APPLY\\'(S,TX)` \\nreturns an error, the protocol defaults to `APPLY\\'(S,TX) = S`. \\nThis provides an easy mechanism for creating an arbitrary \\ncryptocurrency protocol, potentially with advanced features \\nthat cannot be implemented inside of Bitcoin itself, but with a \\nvery low development cost since the complexities of mining \\nand networking are already handled by the Bitcoin protocol. \\nMetacoins have been used to implement some classes of \\nfinancial contracts, name registration and decentralized \\nexchange.\\n\\nThus, in general, there are two approaches toward building a \\nconsensus protocol: building an independent network, and building \\na protocol on top of Bitcoin. The former approach, while reasonably \\nsuccessful in the case of applications like Namecoin, is difficult to \\n\\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit\\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit\\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit\\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit\\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/buterin.com/document/d/1AnkP_cVZTCMLIzw4DvsW6M8Q2JC0lIzrTLuoWu2z1BE/edit\\n\\n\\nimplement; each individual implementation needs to bootstrap an \\nindependent blockchain, as well as building and testing all of the \\nnecessary state transition and networking code. Additionally, we \\npredict that the set of applications for decentralized consensus \\ntechnology will follow a power law distribution where the vast \\nmajority of applications would be too small to warrant their own \\nblockchain, and we note that there exist large classes of \\ndecentralized applications, particularly decentralized autonomous \\norganizations, that need to interact with each other.\\nThe Bitcoin-based approach, on the other hand, has the flaw that it \\ndoes not inherit the simplified payment verification features of \\nBitcoin. SPV works for Bitcoin because it can use blockchain depth \\nas a proxy for validity; at some point, once the ancestors of a \\ntransaction go far enough back, it is safe to say that they were \\nlegitimately part of the state. Blockchain-based meta-protocols, on \\nthe other hand, cannot force the blockchain not to include \\ntransactions that are not valid within the context of their own \\nprotocols. Hence, a fully secure SPV meta-protocol implementation \\nwould need to backward scan all the way to the beginning of the \\nBitcoin blockchain to determine whether or not certain transactions \\nare valid. Currently, all \"light\" implementations of Bitcoin-based \\nmeta-protocols rely on a trusted server to provide the data, arguably \\na highly suboptimal result especially when one of the primary \\npurposes of a cryptocurrency is to eliminate the need for trust.\\n\\ni. Scripting\\nEven without any extensions, the Bitcoin protocol actually does \\nfacilitate a weak version of a concept of \"smart contracts\". UTXO in \\nBitcoin can be owned not just by a public key, but also by a more \\ncomplicated script expressed in a simple stack-based programming \\nlanguage. In this paradigm, a transaction spending that UTXO must \\nprovide data that satisfies the script. Indeed, even the basic public \\nkey ownership mechanism is implemented via a script: the script \\ntakes an elliptic curve signature as input, verifies it against the \\ntransaction and the address that owns the UTXO, and returns 1 if \\nthe verification is successful and 0 otherwise. Other, more \\ncomplicated, scripts exist for various additional use cases. For \\nexample, one can construct a script that requires signatures from \\n\\n\\n\\ntwo out of a given three private keys to validate (\"multisig\"), a setup \\nuseful for corporate accounts, secure savings accounts and some \\nmerchant escrow situations. Scripts can also be used to pay \\nbounties for solutions to computational problems, and one can even \\nconstruct a script that says something like \"this Bitcoin UTXO is \\nyours if you can provide an SPV proof that you sent a Dogecoin \\ntransaction of this denomination to me\", essentially allowing \\ndecentralized cross-cryptocurrency exchange.\\nHowever, the scripting language as implemented in Bitcoin has \\nseveral important limitations:\\n\\nâ€¢ **Lack of Turing-completeness** - that is to say, while there is \\na large subset of computation that the Bitcoin scripting \\nlanguage supports, it does not nearly support everything. The \\nmain category that is missing is loops. This is done to avoid \\ninfinite loops during transaction verification; theoretically it is a \\nsurmountable obstacle for script programmers, since any loop \\ncan be simulated by simply repeating the underlying code \\nmany times with an if statement, but it does lead to scripts that \\nare very space-inefficient. For example, implementing an \\nalternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely \\nrequire 256 repeated multiplication rounds all individually \\nincluded in the code.\\n\\nâ€¢ **Value-blindness** - there is no way for a UTXO script to \\nprovide fine-grained control over the amount that can be \\nwithdrawn. For example, one powerful use case of an oracle \\ncontract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in \\n$1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000 \\nworth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This would require an \\noracle to determine the value of 1 BTC in USD, but even then \\nit is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure \\nrequirement over the fully centralized solutions that are \\navailable now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the \\nonly way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of \\nhaving many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO \\nof 2k\\xa0for every k up to 30) and having O pick which UTXO to \\nsend to A and which to B.\\n\\n\\n\\nâ€¢ **Lack of state** - a [UTXO](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/\\nunspent-transaction-output); there is no opportunity for multi-\\nstage contracts or scripts which keep any other internal state \\nbeyond that. This makes it hard to make multi-stage options \\ncontracts, decentralized exchange offers or two-stage \\ncryptographic commitment protocols (necessary for secure \\ncomputational bounties). It also means that UTXO can only be \\nused to build simple, one-off contracts and not more complex \\n\"stateful\" contracts such as decentralized organizations, and \\nmakes meta-protocols difficult to implement. Binary state \\ncombined with value-blindness also mean that another \\nimportant application, withdrawal limits, is impossible.\\n\\nâ€¢ **Blockchain-blindness** - UTXO are blind to blockchain data \\nsuch as the nonce, the timestamp and previous block hash. \\nThis severely limits applications in gambling, and several other \\ncategories, by depriving the scripting language of a potentially \\nvaluable source of randomness.\\n\\nThus, we see three approaches to building advanced applications \\non top of cryptocurrency: building a new blockchain, using scripting \\non top of Bitcoin, and building a meta-protocol on top of Bitcoin. \\nBuilding a new blockchain allows for unlimited freedom in building a \\nfeature set, but at the cost of development time, bootstrapping effort \\nand security. Using scripting is easy to implement and standardize, \\nbut is very limited in its capabilities, and meta-protocols, while easy, \\nsuffer from faults in scalability. With Ethereum, we intend to build an \\nalternative framework that provides even larger gains in ease of \\ndevelopment as well as even stronger light client properties, while \\nat the same time allowing applications to share an economic \\nenvironment and blockchain security.\\n1. Ethereum\\n\\nThe intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for \\nbuilding decentralized applications, providing a different set of \\ntradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of \\ndecentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations \\nwhere rapid development time, security for small and rarely used \\napplications, and the ability of different applications to very \\nefficiently interact, are important. Ethereum does this by building \\nwhat is essentially the ultimate abstract foundational layer: a \\n\\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output\\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/unspent-transaction-output\\n\\n\\nblockchain with a built-in Turing-complete programming language, \\nallowing anyone to write smart contracts and decentralized \\napplications where they can create their own arbitrary rules for \\nownership, transaction formats and state transition functions. A \\nbare-bones version of Namecoin can be written in two lines of code, \\nand other protocols like currencies and reputation systems can be \\nbuilt in under twenty. Smart contracts, cryptographic \"boxes\" that \\ncontain value and only unlock it if certain conditions are met, can \\nalso be built on top of the platform, with vastly more power than that \\noffered by Bitcoin scripting because of the added powers of Turing-\\ncompleteness, value-awareness, blockchain-awareness and state.\\n\\ni. Philosophy\\nThe design behind Ethereum is intended to follow the following \\nprinciples:\\n1. **Simplicity**: the Ethereum protocol should be as simple as \\npossible, even at the cost of some data storage or time inefficiency.\\n[fn.](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes)\\xa0An average \\nprogrammer should ideally be able to follow and implement the \\nentire specification,[fn.](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-\\nPaper#notes)\\xa0so as to fully realize the unprecedented democratizing \\npotential that cryptocurrency brings and further the vision of \\nEthereum as a protocol that is open to all. Any optimization which \\nadds complexity should not be included unless that optimization \\nprovides very substantial benefit. 2. **Universality**: a fundamental \\npart of Ethereum\\'s design philosophy is that Ethereum does not \\nhave \"features\".[fn.](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-\\nPaper#notes)\\xa0Instead, Ethereum provides an internal Turing-complete \\nscripting language, which a programmer can use to construct any \\nsmart contract or transaction type that can be mathematically \\ndefined. Want to invent your own financial derivative? With \\nEthereum, you can. Want to make your own currency? Set it up as \\nan Ethereum contract. Want to set up a full-scale Daemon or \\nSkynet? You may need to have a few thousand interlocking \\ncontracts, and be sure to feed them generously, to do that, but \\nnothing is stopping you with Ethereum at your fingertips. 3. \\n**Modularity**: the parts of the Ethereum protocol should be \\ndesigned to be as modular and separable as possible. Over the \\ncourse of development, our goal is to create a program where if one \\n\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\n\\n\\nwas to make a small protocol modification in one place, the \\napplication stack would continue to function without any further \\nmodification. Innovations such as Ethash (see the [Yellow](https://\\nethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.J) or [wiki]\\n(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash)), modified Patricia \\ntrees ([Yellow](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/\\npaper.pdf#appendix.D), [wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/\\n%5BEnglish%5D-Patricia-Tree)) and RLP ([YP](https://\\nethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.B), [wiki]\\n(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-RLP)) \\nshould be, and are, implemented as separate, feature-complete \\nlibraries. This is so that even though they are used in Ethereum, \\neven if Ethereum does not require certain features, such features \\nare still usable in other protocols as well. Ethereum development \\nshould be maximally done so as to benefit the entire cryptocurrency \\necosystem, not just itself. 4. **Agility**: details of the Ethereum \\nprotocol are not set in stone. Although we will be extremely \\njudicious about making modifications to high-level constructs, for \\ninstance with the [sharding](https://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-\\nspec/1407/), abstracting execution, with only data availability \\nenshrined in consensus. Computational tests later on in the \\ndevelopment process may lead us to discover that certain \\nmodifications, e.g. to the protocol architecture or to the Ethereum \\nVirtual Machine (EVM), will substantially improve scalability or \\nsecurity. If any such opportunities are found, we will exploit them. 5. \\n**Non-discrimination** and **non-censorship**: the protocol should \\nnot attempt to actively restrict or prevent specific categories of \\nusage. All regulatory mechanisms in the protocol should be \\ndesigned to directly regulate the harm and not attempt to oppose \\nspecific undesirable applications. A programmer can even run an \\ninfinite loop script on top of Ethereum for as long as they are willing \\nto keep paying the per-computational-step transaction fee.\\n\\ni. Ethereum Accounts\\nIn Ethereum, the state is made up of objects called \"accounts\", with \\neach account having a 20-byte address and state transitions being \\ndirect transfers of value and information between accounts. An \\nEthereum account contains four fields:\\n\\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.J\\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.J\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Ethash\\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.D\\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.D\\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.D\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Patricia-Tree\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Patricia-Tree\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-Patricia-Tree\\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.B\\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.B\\nhttps://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf#appendix.B\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%5BEnglish%5D-RLP\\nhttps://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec/1407/\\nhttps://ethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec/1407/\\n\\n\\nâ€¢ The **nonce**, a counter used to make sure each transaction \\ncan only be processed once\\n\\nâ€¢ The account\\'s current **ether balance**\\nâ€¢ The account\\'s **contract code**, if present\\nâ€¢ The account\\'s **storage** (empty by default)\\n\\n\"Ether\" is the main internal crypto-fuel of Ethereum, and is used to \\npay transaction fees. In general, there are two types of accounts: \\n**externally owned accounts**, controlled by private keys, and \\n**contract accounts**, controlled by their contract code. An \\nexternally owned account has no code, and one can send \\nmessages from an externally owned account by creating and \\nsigning a transaction; in a contract account, every time the contract \\naccount receives a message its code activates, allowing it to read \\nand write to internal storage and send other messages or create \\ncontracts in turn.\\nNote that \"contracts\" in Ethereum should not be seen as something \\nthat should be \"fulfilled\" or \"complied with\"; rather, they are more \\nlike \"autonomous agents\" that live inside of the Ethereum execution \\nenvironment, always executing a specific piece of code when \\n\"poked\" by a message or transaction, and having direct control over \\ntheir own ether balance and their own key/value store to keep track \\nof persistent variables.\\n\\ni. Messages and Transactions\\nThe term \"transaction\" is used in Ethereum to refer to the signed \\ndata package that stores a message to be sent from an externally \\nowned account. Transactions contain:\\nâ€¢ The recipient of the message\\nâ€¢ A signature identifying the sender\\nâ€¢ The amount of ether to transfer from the sender to the \\n\\nrecipient\\nâ€¢ An optional data field\\nâ€¢ A `STARTGAS` value, representing the maximum number of \\n\\ncomputational steps the transaction execution is allowed to \\ntake\\n\\nâ€¢ A `GASPRICE` value, representing the fee the sender pays \\nper computational step\\n\\n\\n\\nThe first three are standard fields expected in any cryptocurrency. \\nThe data field has no function by default, but the virtual machine \\nhas an opcode which a contract can use to access the data; as an \\nexample use case, if a contract is functioning as an on-blockchain \\ndomain registration service, then it may wish to interpret the data \\nbeing passed to it as containing two \"fields\", the first field being a \\ndomain to register and the second field being the IP address to \\nregister it to. The contract would read these values from the \\nmessage data and appropriately place them in storage.\\nThe `STARTGAS` and `GASPRICE` fields are crucial for \\nEthereum\\'s anti-denial of service model. In order to prevent \\naccidental or hostile infinite loops or other computational wastage in \\ncode, each transaction is required to set a limit to how many \\ncomputational steps of code execution it can use. The fundamental \\nunit of computation is \"gas\"; usually, a computational step costs 1 \\ngas, but some operations cost higher amounts of gas because they \\nare more computationally expensive, or increase the amount of \\ndata that must be stored as part of the state. There is also a fee of 5 \\ngas for every byte in the transaction data. The intent of the fee \\nsystem is to require an attacker to pay proportionately for every \\nresource that they consume, including computation, bandwidth and \\nstorage; hence, any transaction that leads to the network \\nconsuming a greater amount of any of these resources must have a \\ngas fee roughly proportional to the increment.\\n\\ni. Messages\\nContracts have the ability to send \"messages\" to other contracts. \\nMessages are virtual objects that are never serialized and exist only \\nin the Ethereum execution environment. A message contains:\\nâ€¢ The sender of the message (implicit)\\nâ€¢ The recipient of the message\\nâ€¢ The amount of ether to transfer alongside the message\\nâ€¢ An optional data field\\nâ€¢ A `STARTGAS` value\\n\\nEssentially, a message is like a transaction, except it is produced by \\na contract and not an external actor. A message is produced when a \\ncontract currently executing code executes the `CALL` opcode, \\nwhich produces and executes a message. Like a transaction, a \\n\\n\\n\\nmessage leads to the recipient account running its code. Thus, \\ncontracts can have relationships with other contracts in exactly the \\nsame way that external actors can.\\nNote that the gas allowance assigned by a transaction or contract \\napplies to the total gas consumed by that transaction and all sub-\\nexecutions. For example, if an external actor A sends a transaction \\nto B with 1000 gas, and B consumes 600 gas before sending a \\nmessage to C, and the internal execution of C consumes 300 gas \\nbefore returning, then B can spend another 100 gas before running \\nout of gas.\\n\\ni. Ethereum State Transition Function\\n![ethertransition.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\\nethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/\\nethertransition.png)\\nThe Ethereum state transition function, `APPLY(S,TX) -> S\\'` can be \\ndefined as follows:\\n\\n1. Check if the transaction is well-formed (ie. has the right number \\nof values), the signature is valid, and the nonce matches the nonce \\nin the sender\\'s account. If not, return an error. 2. Calculate the \\ntransaction fee as `STARTGAS * GASPRICE`, and determine the \\nsending address from the signature. Subtract the fee from the \\nsender\\'s account balance and increment the sender\\'s nonce. If \\nthere is not enough balance to spend, return an error. 3. Initialize \\n`GAS = STARTGAS`, and take off a certain quantity of gas per byte \\nto pay for the bytes in the transaction. 4. Transfer the transaction \\nvalue from the sender\\'s account to the receiving account. If the \\nreceiving account does not yet exist, create it. If the receiving \\naccount is a contract, run the contract\\'s code either to completion or \\nuntil the execution runs out of gas. 5. If the value transfer failed \\nbecause the sender did not have enough money, or the code \\nexecution ran out of gas, revert all state changes except the \\npayment of the fees, and add the fees to the miner\\'s account. 6. \\nOtherwise, refund the fees for all remaining gas to the sender, and \\nsend the fees paid for gas consumed to the miner.\\n\\nFor example, suppose that the contract\\'s code is:\\n\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/ethertransition.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/ethertransition.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/ethertransition.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/ethertransition.png\\n\\n\\n    if !self.storage[calldataload(0)]: \\n        self.storage[calldataload(0)] = calldataload(32) \\nNote that in reality the contract code is written in the low-level EVM \\ncode; this example is written in Serpent, one of our high-level \\nlanguages, for clarity, and can be compiled down to EVM code. \\nSuppose that the contract\\'s storage starts off empty, and a \\ntransaction is sent with 10 ether value, 2000 gas, 0.001 ether \\ngasprice, and 64 bytes of data, with bytes 0-31 representing the \\nnumber `2` and bytes 32-63 representing the string `CHARLIE`.[fn.]\\n(https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes)\\xa0The process for the \\nstate transition function in this case is as follows:\\n\\n1. Check that the transaction is valid and well formed. 2. Check that \\nthe transaction sender has at least 2000 * 0.001 = 2 ether. If it is, \\nthen subtract 2 ether from the sender\\'s account. 3. Initialize gas = \\n2000; assuming the transaction is 170 bytes long and the byte-fee \\nis 5, subtract 850 so that there is 1150 gas left. 3. Subtract 10 more \\nether from the sender\\'s account, and add it to the contract\\'s \\naccount. 4. Run the code. In this case, this is simple: it checks if the \\ncontract\\'s storage at index `2` is used, notices that it is not, and so it \\nsets the storage at index `2` to the value `CHARLIE`. Suppose this \\ntakes 187 gas, so the remaining amount of gas is 1150 - 187 = 963 \\n5. Add 963 * 0.001 = 0.963 ether back to the sender\\'s account, and \\nreturn the resulting state.\\n\\nIf there was no contract at the receiving end of the transaction, then \\nthe total transaction fee would simply be equal to the provided \\n`GASPRICE` multiplied by the length of the transaction in bytes, \\nand the data sent alongside the transaction would be irrelevant.\\n\\nNote that messages work equivalently to transactions in terms of \\nreverts: if a message execution runs out of gas, then that \\nmessage\\'s execution, and all other executions triggered by that \\nexecution, revert, but parent executions do not need to revert. This \\nmeans that it is \"safe\" for a contract to call another contract, as if A \\ncalls B with G gas then A\\'s execution is guaranteed to lose at most \\nG gas. Finally, note that there is an opcode, `CREATE`, that creates \\na contract; its execution mechanics are generally similar to `CALL`, \\n\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper#notes\\n\\n\\nwith the exception that the output of the execution determines the \\ncode of a newly created contract.\\n\\ni. Code Execution\\nThe code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-\\nbased bytecode language, referred to as \"Ethereum virtual machine \\ncode\" or \"EVM code\". The code consists of a series of bytes, where \\neach byte represents an operation. In general, code execution is an \\ninfinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out the operation at \\nthe current program counter (which begins at zero) and then \\nincrementing the program counter by one, until the end of the code \\nis reached or an error or `STOP` or `RETURN` instruction is \\ndetected. The operations have access to three types of space in \\nwhich to store data:\\nâ€¢ The **stack**, a last-in-first-out container to which values can \\n\\nbe pushed and popped\\nâ€¢ **Memory**, an infinitely expandable byte array\\nâ€¢ The contract\\'s long-term **storage**, a key/value store. Unlike \\n\\nstack and memory, which reset after computation ends, \\nstorage persists for the long term.\\n\\nThe code can also access the value, sender and data of the \\nincoming message, as well as block header data, and the code can \\nalso return a byte array of data as an output.\\nThe formal execution model of EVM code is surprisingly simple. \\nWhile the Ethereum virtual machine is running, its full computational \\nstate can be defined by the tuple `(block_state, transaction, \\nmessage, code, memory, stack, pc, gas)`, where `block_state` is \\nthe global state containing all accounts and includes balances and \\nstorage. At the start of every round of execution, the current \\ninstruction is found by taking the `pc`-th byte of `code` (or 0 if `pc >= \\nlen(code)`), and each instruction has its own definition in terms of \\nhow it affects the tuple. For example, `ADD` pops two items off the \\nstack and pushes their sum, reduces `gas` by 1 and increments \\n`pc` by 1, and `SSTORE` pops the top two items off the stack and \\ninserts the second item into the contract\\'s storage at the index \\nspecified by the first item. Although there are many ways to \\noptimize Ethereum virtual machine execution via just-in-time \\n\\n\\n\\ncompilation, a basic implementation of Ethereum can be done in a \\nfew hundred lines of code.\\n\\ni. Blockchain and Mining\\n![apply_block_diagram.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/\\nethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/\\napply_block_diagram.png)\\nThe Ethereum blockchain is in many ways similar to the Bitcoin \\nblockchain, although it does have some differences. The main \\ndifference between Ethereum and Bitcoin with regard to the \\nblockchain architecture is that, unlike Bitcoin(which only contains a \\ncopy of the transaction list), Ethereum blocks contain a copy of both \\nthe transaction list and the most recent state. Aside from that, two \\nother values, the block number and the difficulty, are also stored in \\nthe block. The basic block validation algorithm in Ethereum is as \\nfollows:\\n\\n1. Check if the previous block referenced exists and is valid. 2. \\nCheck that the timestamp of the block is greater than that of the \\nreferenced previous block and less than 15 minutes into the future \\n3. Check that the block number, difficulty, transaction root, uncle \\nroot and gas limit (various low-level Ethereum-specific concepts) \\nare valid. 4. Check that the proof of work on the block is valid. 5. Let \\n`S[0]` be the state at the end of the previous block. 6. Let `TX` be \\nthe block\\'s transaction list, with `n` transactions. For all `i` in \\n`0...n-1`, set `S[i+1] = APPLY(S[i],TX[i])`. If any application returns \\nan error, or if the total gas consumed in the block up until this point \\nexceeds the `GASLIMIT`, return an error. 7. Let `S_FINAL` be \\n`S[n]`, but adding the block reward paid to the miner. 8. Check if the \\nMerkle tree root of the state `S_FINAL` is equal to the final state \\nroot provided in the block header. If it is, the block is valid; \\notherwise, it is not valid.\\n\\nThe approach may seem highly inefficient at first glance, because it \\nneeds to store the entire state with each block, but in reality \\nefficiency should be comparable to that of Bitcoin. The reason is \\nthat the state is stored in the tree structure, and after every block \\nonly a small part of the tree needs to be changed. Thus, in general, \\n\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/apply_block_diagram.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/apply_block_diagram.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/apply_block_diagram.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/apply_block_diagram.png\\n\\n\\nbetween two adjacent blocks the vast majority of the tree should be \\nthe same, and therefore the data can be stored once and \\nreferenced twice using pointers (ie. hashes of subtrees). A special \\nkind of tree known as a \"Patricia tree\" is used to accomplish this, \\nincluding a modification to the Merkle tree concept that allows for \\nnodes to be inserted and deleted, and not just changed, efficiently. \\nAdditionally, because all of the state information is part of the last \\nblock, there is no need to store the entire blockchain history - a \\nstrategy which, if it could be applied to Bitcoin, can be calculated to \\nprovide 5-20x savings in space.\\n\\nA commonly asked question is \"where\" contract code is executed, in \\nterms of physical hardware. This has a simple answer: the process \\nof executing contract code is part of the definition of the state \\ntransition function, which is part of the block validation algorithm, so \\nif a transaction is added into block `B` the code execution spawned \\nby that transaction will be executed by all nodes, now and in the \\nfuture, that download and validate block `B`.\\n\\n1. Applications\\nIn general, there are three types of applications on top of Ethereum. \\nThe first category is financial applications, providing users with \\nmore powerful ways of managing and entering into contracts using \\ntheir money. This includes sub-currencies, financial derivatives, \\nhedging contracts, savings wallets, wills, and ultimately even some \\nclasses of full-scale employment contracts. The second category is \\nsemi-financial applications, where money is involved but there is \\nalso a heavy non-monetary side to what is being done; a perfect \\nexample is self-enforcing bounties for solutions to computational \\nproblems. Finally, there are applications such as online voting and \\ndecentralized governance that are not financial at all.\\n\\ni. Token Systems\\nOn-blockchain token systems have many applications ranging from \\nsub-currencies representing assets such as USD or gold to \\ncompany stocks, individual tokens representing smart property, \\nsecure unforgeable coupons, and even token systems with no ties \\nto conventional value at all, used as point systems for \\nincentivization. Token systems are surprisingly easy to implement in \\n\\n\\n\\nEthereum. The key point to understand is that a currency, or token \\nsystem, fundamentally is a database with one operation: subtract X \\nunits from A and give X units to B, with the provision that (1) A had \\nat least X units before the transaction and (2) the transaction is \\napproved by A. All that it takes to implement a token system is to \\nimplement this logic into a contract.\\nThe basic code for implementing a token system in Serpent looks \\nas follows:\\n\\n    def send(to, value): \\n        if self.storage[msg.sender] >= value: \\n            self.storage[msg.sender] = \\nself.storage[msg.sender] - value \\n            self.storage[to] = self.storage[to] + value \\nThis is essentially a literal implementation of the \"banking system\" \\nstate transition function described further above in this document. A \\nfew extra lines of code need to be added to provide for the initial \\nstep of distributing the currency units in the first place and a few \\nother edge cases, and ideally a function would be added to let other \\ncontracts query for the balance of an address. But that\\'s all there is \\nto it. Theoretically, Ethereum-based token systems acting as sub-\\ncurrencies can potentially include another important feature that on-\\nchain Bitcoin-based meta-currencies lack: the ability to pay \\ntransaction fees directly in that currency. The way this would be \\nimplemented is that the contract would maintain an ether balance \\nwith which it would refund ether used to pay fees to the sender, and \\nit would refill this balance by collecting the internal currency units \\nthat it takes in fees and reselling them in a constant running \\nauction. Users would thus need to \"activate\" their accounts with \\nether, but once the ether is there it would be reusable because the \\ncontract would refund it each time.\\n\\ni. Financial derivatives and Stable-Value Currencies\\nFinancial derivatives are the most common application of a \"smart \\ncontract\", and one of the simplest to implement in code. The main \\nchallenge in implementing financial contracts is that the majority of \\nthem require reference to an external price ticker; for example, a \\nvery desirable application is a smart contract that hedges against \\n\\n\\n\\nthe volatility of ether (or another cryptocurrency) with respect to the \\nUS dollar, but doing this requires the contract to know what the \\nvalue of ETH/USD is. The simplest way to do this is through a \"data \\nfeed\" contract maintained by a specific party (eg. NASDAQ) \\ndesigned so that that party has the ability to update the contract as \\nneeded, and providing an interface that allows other contracts to \\nsend a message to that contract and get back a response that \\nprovides the price.\\nGiven that critical ingredient, the hedging contract would look as \\nfollows:\\n\\n1. Wait for party A to input 1000 ether. 2. Wait for party B to input \\n1000 ether. 3. Record the USD value of 1000 ether, calculated by \\nquerying the data feed contract, in storage, say this is $x. 4. After \\n30 days, allow A or B to \"reactivate\" the contract in order to send $x \\nworth of ether (calculated by querying the data feed contract again \\nto get the new price) to A and the rest to B.\\n\\nSuch a contract would have significant potential in crypto-\\ncommerce. One of the main problems cited about cryptocurrency is \\nthe fact that it\\'s volatile; although many users and merchants may \\nwant the security and convenience of dealing with cryptographic \\nassets, they may not wish to face that prospect of losing 23% of the \\nvalue of their funds in a single day. Up until now, the most \\ncommonly proposed solution has been issuer-backed assets; the \\nidea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the \\nright to issue and revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency \\nto anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a specified \\nunderlying asset (eg. gold, USD). The issuer then promises to \\nprovide one unit of the underlying asset to anyone who sends back \\none unit of the crypto-asset. This mechanism allows any non-\\ncryptographic asset to be \"uplifted\" into a cryptographic asset, \\nprovided that the issuer can be trusted.\\n\\nIn practice, however, issuers are not always trustworthy, and in \\nsome cases the banking infrastructure is too weak, or too hostile, \\nfor such services to exist. Financial derivatives provide an \\nalternative. Here, instead of a single issuer providing the funds to \\n\\n\\n\\nback up an asset, a decentralized market of speculators, betting \\nthat the price of a cryptographic reference asset (eg. ETH) will go \\nup, plays that role. Unlike issuers, speculators have no option to \\ndefault on their side of the bargain because the hedging contract \\nholds their funds in escrow. Note that this approach is not fully \\ndecentralized, because a trusted source is still needed to provide \\nthe price ticker, although arguably even still this is a massive \\nimprovement in terms of reducing infrastructure requirements \\n(unlike being an issuer, issuing a price feed requires no licenses \\nand can likely be categorized as free speech) and reducing the \\npotential for fraud.\\n\\ni. Identity and Reputation Systems\\nThe earliest alternative cryptocurrency of all, [Namecoin](http://\\nnamecoin.org/), attempted to use a Bitcoin-like blockchain to \\nprovide a name registration system, where users can register their \\nnames in a public database alongside other data. The major cited \\nuse case is for a [DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/\\nDomain_Name_System) system, mapping domain names like \\n\"bitcoin.org\" (or, in Namecoin\\'s case, \"bitcoin.bit\") to an IP address. \\nOther use cases include email authentication and potentially more \\nadvanced reputation systems. Here is the basic contract to provide \\na Namecoin-like name registration system on Ethereum:\\n    def register(name, value): \\n        if !self.storage[name]: \\n            self.storage[name] = value \\nThe contract is very simple; all it is a database inside the Ethereum \\nnetwork that can be added to, but not modified or removed from. \\nAnyone can register a name with some value, and that registration \\nthen sticks forever. A more sophisticated name registration contract \\nwill also have a \"function clause\" allowing other contracts to query \\nit, as well as a mechanism for the \"owner\" (ie. the first registerer) of \\na name to change the data or transfer ownership. One can even \\nadd reputation and web-of-trust functionality on top.\\n\\ni. Decentralized File Storage\\nOver the past few years, there have emerged a number of popular \\nonline file storage startups, the most prominent being Dropbox, \\n\\nhttp://namecoin.org/\\nhttp://namecoin.org/\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\\n\\n\\nseeking to allow users to upload a backup of their hard drive and \\nhave the service store the backup and allow the user to access it in \\nexchange for a monthly fee. However, at this point the file storage \\nmarket is at times relatively inefficient; a cursory look at various \\n[existing](http://online-storage-service-review.toptenreviews.com/) \\nshows that, particularly at the \"uncanny valley\" 20-200 GB level at \\nwhich neither free quotas nor enterprise-level discounts kick in, \\nmonthly prices for mainstream file storage costs are such that you \\nare paying for more than the cost of the entire hard drive in a single \\nmonth. Ethereum contracts can allow for the development of a \\ndecentralized file storage ecosystem, where individual users can \\nearn small quantities of money by renting out their own hard drives \\nand unused space can be used to further drive down the costs of \\nfile storage.\\nThe key underpinning piece of such a device would be what we \\nhave termed the \"decentralized Dropbox contract\". This contract \\nworks as follows. First, one splits the desired data up into blocks, \\nencrypting each block for privacy, and builds a Merkle tree out of it. \\nOne then makes a contract with the rule that, every N blocks, the \\ncontract would pick a random index in the Merkle tree (using the \\nprevious block hash, accessible from contract code, as a source of \\nrandomness), and give X ether to the first entity to supply a \\ntransaction with a simplified payment verification-like proof of \\nownership of the block at that particular index in the tree. When a \\nuser wants to re-download their file, they can use a micropayment \\nchannel protocol (eg. pay 1 szabo per 32 kilobytes) to recover the \\nfile; the most fee-efficient approach is for the payer not to publish \\nthe transaction until the end, instead replacing the transaction with \\na slightly more lucrative one with the same nonce after every 32 \\nkilobytes.\\n\\nAn important feature of the protocol is that, although it may seem \\nlike one is trusting many random nodes not to decide to forget the \\nfile, one can reduce that risk down to near-zero by splitting the file \\ninto many pieces via secret sharing, and watching the contracts to \\nsee each piece is still in some node\\'s possession. If a contract is \\nstill paying out money, that provides a cryptographic proof that \\nsomeone out there is still storing the file.\\n\\nhttp://online-storage-service-review.toptenreviews.com/\\n\\n\\ni. Decentralized Autonomous Organizations\\nThe general concept of a \"decentralized autonomous organization\" \\nis that of a virtual entity that has a certain set of members or \\nshareholders which, perhaps with a 67% majority, have the right to \\nspend the entity\\'s funds and modify its code. The members would \\ncollectively decide on how the organization should allocate its \\nfunds. Methods for allocating a DAO\\'s funds could range from \\nbounties, salaries to even more exotic mechanisms such as an \\ninternal currency to reward work. This essentially replicates the \\nlegal trappings of a traditional company or nonprofit but using only \\ncryptographic blockchain technology for enforcement. So far much \\nof the talk around DAOs has been around the \"capitalist\" model of a \\n\"decentralized autonomous corporation\" (DAC) with dividend-\\nreceiving shareholders and tradable shares; an alternative, perhaps \\ndescribed as a \"decentralized autonomous community\", would have \\nall members have an equal share in the decision making and \\nrequire 67% of existing members to agree to add or remove a \\nmember. The requirement that one person can only have one \\nmembership would then need to be enforced collectively by the \\ngroup.\\nA general outline for how to code a DAO is as follows. The simplest \\ndesign is simply a piece of self-modifying code that changes if two \\nthirds of members agree on a change. Although code is \\ntheoretically immutable, one can easily get around this and have \\nde-facto mutability by having chunks of the code in separate \\ncontracts, and having the address of which contracts to call stored \\nin the modifiable storage. In a simple implementation of such a \\nDAO contract, there would be three transaction types, distinguished \\nby the data provided in the transaction:\\n\\nâ€¢ `[0,i,K,V]` to register a proposal with index `i` to change the \\naddress at storage index `K` to value `V`\\n\\nâ€¢ `[1,i]` to register a vote in favor of proposal `i`\\nâ€¢ `[2,i]` to finalize proposal `i` if enough votes have been made\\n\\nThe contract would then have clauses for each of these. It would \\nmaintain a record of all open storage changes, along with a list of \\nwho voted for them. It would also have a list of all members. When \\nany storage change gets to two thirds of members voting for it, a \\n\\n\\n\\nfinalizing transaction could execute the change. A more \\nsophisticated skeleton would also have built-in voting ability for \\nfeatures like sending a transaction, adding members and removing \\nmembers, and may even provide for [Liquid](http://en.wikipedia.org/\\nwiki/Delegative_democracy)-style\\xa0vote delegation (ie. anyone can \\nassign someone to vote for them, and assignment is transitive so if \\nA assigns B and B assigns C then C determines A\\'s vote). This \\ndesign would allow the DAO to grow organically as a decentralized \\ncommunity, allowing people to eventually delegate the task of \\nfiltering out who is a member to specialists, although unlike in the \\n\"current system\" specialists can easily pop in and out of existence \\nover time as individual community members change their \\nalignments.\\nAn alternative model is for a decentralized corporation, where any \\naccount can have zero or more shares, and two thirds of the shares \\nare required to make a decision. A complete skeleton would involve \\nasset management functionality, the ability to make an offer to buy \\nor sell shares, and the ability to accept offers (preferably with an \\norder-matching mechanism inside the contract). Delegation would \\nalso exist Liquid Democracy-style, generalizing the concept of a \\n\"board of directors\".\\n\\ni. Further Applications\\nâ—¦ 1. Savings wallets**. Suppose that Alice wants to keep \\n\\nher funds safe, but is worried that she will lose or \\nsomeone will hack her private key. She puts ether into a \\ncontract with Bob, a bank, as follows:\\n\\nâ€¢ Alice alone can withdraw a maximum of 1% of the funds per \\nday.\\n\\nâ€¢ Bob alone can withdraw a maximum of 1% of the funds per \\nday, but Alice has the ability to make a transaction with her key \\nshutting off this ability.\\n\\nâ€¢ Alice and Bob together can withdraw anything.\\nNormally, 1% per day is enough for Alice, and if Alice wants to \\nwithdraw more she can contact Bob for help. If Alice\\'s key gets \\nhacked, she runs to Bob to move the funds to a new contract. If she \\nloses her key, Bob will get the funds out eventually. If Bob turns out \\nto be malicious, then she can turn off his ability to withdraw.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy)-style\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delegative_democracy)-style\\n\\n\\nâ—¦ 2. Crop insurance**. One can easily make a financial \\nderivatives contract but using a data feed of the weather \\ninstead of any price index. If a farmer in Iowa purchases \\na derivative that pays out inversely based on the \\nprecipitation in Iowa, then if there is a drought, the farmer \\nwill automatically receive money and if there is enough \\nrain the farmer will be happy because their crops would \\ndo well. This can be expanded to natural disaster \\ninsurance generally.\\n\\nâ—¦ 3. A decentralized data feed**. For financial contracts for \\ndifference, it may actually be possible to decentralize the \\ndata feed via a protocol called [SchellingCoin](http://\\nblog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-\\ntrust-universal-data-feed/). SchellingCoin basically works \\nas follows: N parties all put into the system the value of a \\ngiven datum (eg. the ETH/USD price), the values are \\nsorted, and everyone between the 25th and 75th \\npercentile gets one token as a reward. Everyone has the \\nincentive to provide the answer that everyone else will \\nprovide, and the only value that a large number of players \\ncan realistically agree on is the obvious default: the truth. \\nThis creates a decentralized protocol that can \\ntheoretically provide any number of values, including the \\nETH/USD price, the temperature in Berlin or even the \\nresult of a particular hard computation.\\n\\nâ—¦ 4. Smart multisignature escrow**. Bitcoin allows \\nmultisignature transaction contracts where, for example, \\nthree out of a given five keys can spend the funds. \\nEthereum allows for more granularity; for example, four \\nout of five can spend everything, three out of five can \\nspend up to 10% per day, and two out of five can spend \\nup to 0.5% per day. Additionally, Ethereum multisig is \\nasynchronous - two parties can register their signatures \\non the blockchain at different times and the last signature \\nwill automatically send the transaction.\\n\\nâ—¦ 5. Cloud computing**. The EVM technology can also be \\nused to create a verifiable computing environment, \\nallowing users to ask others to carry out computations \\n\\nhttp://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/\\nhttp://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/\\nhttp://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/\\n\\n\\nand then optionally ask for proofs that computations at \\ncertain randomly selected checkpoints were done \\ncorrectly. This allows for the creation of a cloud \\ncomputing market where any user can participate with \\ntheir desktop, laptop or specialized server, and spot-\\nchecking together with security deposits can be used to \\nensure that the system is trustworthy (ie. nodes cannot \\nprofitably cheat). Although such a system may not be \\nsuitable for all tasks; tasks that require a high level of \\ninter-process communication, for example, cannot easily \\nbe done on a large cloud of nodes. Other tasks, however, \\nare much easier to parallelize; projects like SETI@home, \\nfolding@home and genetic algorithms can easily be \\nimplemented on top of such a platform.\\n\\nâ—¦ 6. Peer-to-peer gambling**. Any number of peer-to-peer \\ngambling protocols, such as Frank Stajano and Richard \\nClayton\\'s [Cyberdice](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/\\npapers/2008-StajanoCla-cyberdice.pdf), can be \\nimplemented on the Ethereum blockchain. The simplest \\ngambling protocol is actually simply a contract for \\ndifference on the next block hash, and more advanced \\nprotocols can be built up from there, creating gambling \\nservices with near-zero fees that have no ability to cheat.\\n\\nâ—¦ 7. Prediction markets**. Provided an oracle or \\nSchellingCoin, prediction markets are also easy to \\nimplement, and prediction markets together with \\nSchellingCoin may prove to be the first mainstream \\napplication of [futarchy](http://hanson.gmu.edu/\\nfutarchy.html) as a governance protocol for decentralized \\norganizations.\\n\\nâ—¦ 8. On-chain decentralized marketplaces**, using the \\nidentity and reputation system as a base.\\n\\n1. Miscellanea And Concerns\\ni. Modified GHOST Implementation\\n\\nThe \"Greedy Heaviest Observed Subtree\" (GHOST) protocol is an \\ninnovation first introduced by Yonatan Sompolinsky and Aviv Zohar \\nin [December](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf). The motivation \\nbehind GHOST is that blockchains with fast confirmation times \\n\\nhttp://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2008-StajanoCla-cyberdice.pdf\\nhttp://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2008-StajanoCla-cyberdice.pdf\\nhttp://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~fms27/papers/2008-StajanoCla-cyberdice.pdf\\nhttp://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html\\nhttp://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.html\\nhttps://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf\\n\\n\\ncurrently suffer from reduced security due to a high stale rate - \\nbecause blocks take a certain time to propagate through the \\nnetwork, if miner A mines a block and then miner B happens to \\nmine another block before miner A\\'s block propagates to B, miner \\nB\\'s block will end up wasted and will not contribute to network \\nsecurity. Furthermore, there is a centralization issue: if miner A is a \\nmining pool with 30% hashpower and B has 10% hashpower, A will \\nhave a risk of producing a stale block 70% of the time (since the \\nother 30% of the time A produced the last block and so will get \\nmining data immediately) whereas B will have a risk of producing a \\nstale block 90% of the time. Thus, if the block interval is short \\nenough for the stale rate to be high, A will be substantially more \\nefficient simply by virtue of its size. With these two effects \\ncombined, blockchains which produce blocks quickly are very likely \\nto lead to one mining pool having a large enough percentage of the \\nnetwork hashpower to have de facto control over the mining \\nprocess.\\nAs described by Sompolinsky and Zohar, GHOST solves the first \\nissue of network security loss by including stale blocks in the \\ncalculation of which chain is the \"longest\"; that is to say, not just the \\nparent and further ancestors of a block, but also the stale \\ndescendants of the block\\'s ancestor (in Ethereum jargon, \"uncles\") \\nare added to the calculation of which block has the largest total \\nproof of work backing it. To solve the second issue of centralization \\nbias, we go beyond the protocol described by Sompolinsky and \\nZohar, and also provide block rewards to stales: a stale block \\nreceives 87.5% of its base reward, and the nephew that includes \\nthe stale block receives the remaining 12.5%. Transaction fees, \\nhowever, are not awarded to uncles.\\n\\nEthereum implements a simplified version of GHOST which only \\ngoes down seven levels. Specifically, it is defined as follows:\\n\\nâ€¢ A block must specify a parent, and it must specify 0 or more \\nuncles\\n\\nâ€¢ An uncle included in block `B` must have the following \\nproperties:\\n\\n\\n\\n  * It must be a direct child of the `k`-th generation \\nancestor of `B`, where `2 <= k <= 7`. \\n  * It cannot be an ancestor of `B` \\n  * An uncle must be a valid block header, but does not \\nneed to be a previously verified or even valid block \\n  * An uncle must be different from all uncles included in \\nprevious blocks and all other uncles included in the same \\nblock (non-double-inclusion) \\nâ€¢ For every uncle `U` in block `B`, the miner of `B` gets an \\n\\nadditional 3.125% added to its coinbase reward and the miner \\nof U gets 93.75% of a standard coinbase reward.\\n\\nThis limited version of GHOST, with uncles includable only up to 7 \\ngenerations, was used for two reasons. First, unlimited GHOST \\nwould include too many complications into the calculation of which \\nuncles for a given block are valid. Second, unlimited GHOST with \\ncompensation as used in Ethereum removes the incentive for a \\nminer to mine on the main chain and not the chain of a public \\nattacker.\\n\\ni. Fees\\nBecause every transaction published into the blockchain imposes \\non the network the cost of needing to download and verify it, there \\nis a need for some regulatory mechanism, typically involving \\ntransaction fees, to prevent abuse. The default approach, used in \\nBitcoin, is to have purely voluntary fees, relying on miners to act as \\nthe gatekeepers and set dynamic minimums. This approach has \\nbeen received very favorably in the Bitcoin community particularly \\nbecause it is \"market-based\", allowing supply and demand between \\nminers and transaction senders determine the price. The problem \\nwith this line of reasoning is, however, that transaction processing is \\nnot a market; although it is intuitively attractive to construe \\ntransaction processing as a service that the miner is offering to the \\nsender, in reality every transaction that a miner includes will need to \\nbe processed by every node in the network, so the vast majority of \\nthe cost of transaction processing is borne by third parties and not \\nthe miner that is making the decision of whether or not to include it. \\nHence, tragedy-of-the-commons problems are very likely to occur.\\nHowever, as it turns out this flaw in the market-based mechanism, \\nwhen given a particular inaccurate simplifying assumption, \\n\\n\\n\\nmagically cancels itself out. The argument is as follows. Suppose \\nthat:\\n\\n1. A transaction leads to `k` operations, offering the reward `kR` to \\nany miner that includes it where `R` is set by the sender and `k` and \\n`R` are (roughly) visible to the miner beforehand. 2. An operation \\nhas a processing cost of `C` to any node (ie. all nodes have equal \\nefficiency) 3. There are `N` mining nodes, each with exactly equal \\nprocessing power (ie. `1/N` of total) 4. No non-mining full nodes \\nexist.\\n\\nA miner would be willing to process a transaction if the expected \\nreward is greater than the cost. Thus, the expected reward is `kR/N` \\nsince the miner has a `1/N` chance of processing the next block, \\nand the processing cost for the miner is simply `kC`. Hence, miners \\nwill include transactions where `kR/N > kC`, or `R > NC`. Note that \\n`R` is the per-operation fee provided by the sender, and is thus a \\nlower bound on the benefit that the sender derives from the \\ntransaction, and `NC` is the cost to the entire network together of \\nprocessing an operation. Hence, miners have the incentive to \\ninclude only those transactions for which the total utilitarian benefit \\nexceeds the cost.\\n\\nHowever, there are several important deviations from those \\nassumptions in reality:\\n\\n1. The miner does pay a higher cost to process the transaction than \\nthe other verifying nodes, since the extra verification time delays \\nblock propagation and thus increases the chance the block will \\nbecome a stale. 2. There do exist non-mining full nodes. 3. The \\nmining power distribution may end up radically inegalitarian in \\npractice. 4. Speculators, political enemies and crazies whose utility \\nfunction includes causing harm to the network do exist, and they \\ncan cleverly set up contracts where their cost is much lower than \\nthe cost paid by other verifying nodes.\\n\\n(1) provides a tendency for the miner to include fewer transactions, \\nand (2) increases `NC`; hence, these two effects at least partially \\ncancel each other out.[How?](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/issues/\\n\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/issues/447#issuecomment-316972260\\n\\n\\n447#issuecomment-316972260)\\xa0(3) and (4) are the major issue; to solve \\nthem we simply institute a floating cap: no block can have more \\noperations than `BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR` times the long-term \\nexponential moving average. Specifically:\\n\\n    blk.oplimit = floor((blk.parent.oplimit * (EMAFACTOR - \\n1) + floor(parent.opcount * BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR)) / \\nEMA_FACTOR) \\n`BLK_LIMIT_FACTOR` and `EMA_FACTOR` are constants that will \\nbe set to 65536 and 1.5 for the time being, but will likely be \\nchanged after further analysis.\\n\\nThere is another factor disincentivizing large block sizes in Bitcoin: \\nblocks that are large will take longer to propagate, and thus have a \\nhigher probability of becoming stales. In Ethereum, highly gas-\\nconsuming blocks can also take longer to propagate both because \\nthey are physically larger and because they take longer to process \\nthe transaction state transitions to validate. This delay disincentive \\nis a significant consideration in Bitcoin, but less so in Ethereum \\nbecause of the GHOST protocol; hence, relying on regulated block \\nlimits provides a more stable baseline.\\n\\ni. Computation And Turing-Completeness\\nAn important note is that the Ethereum virtual machine is Turing-\\ncomplete; this means that EVM code can encode any computation \\nthat can be conceivably carried out, including infinite loops. EVM \\ncode allows looping in two ways. First, there is a `JUMP` instruction \\nthat allows the program to jump back to a previous spot in the code, \\nand a `JUMPI` instruction to do conditional jumping, allowing for \\nstatements like `while x < 27: x = x * 2`. Second, contracts can call \\nother contracts, potentially allowing for looping through recursion. \\nThis naturally leads to a problem: can malicious users essentially \\nshut miners and full nodes down by forcing them to enter into an \\ninfinite loop? The issue arises because of a problem in computer \\nscience known as the halting problem: there is no way to tell, in the \\ngeneral case, whether or not a given program will ever halt.\\nAs described in the state transition section, our solution works by \\nrequiring a transaction to set a maximum number of computational \\n\\nhttps://github.com/ethereum/wiki/issues/447#issuecomment-316972260\\n\\n\\nsteps that it is allowed to take, and if execution takes longer \\ncomputation is reverted but fees are still paid. Messages work in the \\nsame way. To show the motivation behind our solution, consider the \\nfollowing examples:\\n\\nâ€¢ An attacker creates a contract which runs an infinite loop, and \\nthen sends a transaction activating that loop to the miner. The \\nminer will process the transaction, running the infinite loop, \\nand wait for it to run out of gas. Even though the execution \\nruns out of gas and stops halfway through, the transaction is \\nstill valid and the miner still claims the fee from the attacker for \\neach computational step.\\n\\nâ€¢ An attacker creates a very long infinite loop with the intent of \\nforcing the miner to keep computing for such a long time that \\nby the time computation finishes a few more blocks will have \\ncome out and it will not be possible for the miner to include the \\ntransaction to claim the fee. However, the attacker will be \\nrequired to submit a value for `STARTGAS` limiting the \\nnumber of computational steps that execution can take, so the \\nminer will know ahead of time that the computation will take an \\nexcessively large number of steps.\\n\\nâ€¢ An attacker sees a contract with code of some form like \\n`send(A,contract.storage[A]); contract.storage[A] = 0`, and \\nsends a transaction with just enough gas to run the first step \\nbut not the second (ie. making a withdrawal but not letting the \\nbalance go down). The contract author does not need to worry \\nabout protecting against such attacks, because if execution \\nstops halfway through the changes they get reverted.\\n\\nâ€¢ A financial contract works by taking the median of nine \\nproprietary data feeds in order to minimize risk. An attacker \\ntakes over one of the data feeds, which is designed to be \\nmodifiable via the variable-address-call mechanism described \\nin the section on DAOs, and converts it to run an infinite loop, \\nthereby attempting to force any attempts to claim funds from \\nthe financial contract to run out of gas. However, the financial \\ncontract can set a gas limit on the message to prevent this \\nproblem.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe alternative to Turing-completeness is Turing-incompleteness, \\nwhere `JUMP` and `JUMPI` do not exist and only one copy of each \\ncontract is allowed to exist in the call stack at any given time. With \\nthis system, the fee system described and the uncertainties around \\nthe effectiveness of our solution might not be necessary, as the cost \\nof executing a contract would be bounded above by its size. \\nAdditionally, Turing-incompleteness is not even that big a limitation; \\nout of all the contract examples we have conceived internally, so far \\nonly one required a loop, and even that loop could be removed by \\nmaking 26 repetitions of a one-line piece of code. Given the serious \\nimplications of Turing-completeness, and the limited benefit, why \\nnot simply have a Turing-incomplete language? In reality, however, \\nTuring-incompleteness is far from a neat solution to the problem. To \\nsee why, consider the following contracts:\\n    C0: call(C1); call(C1); \\n    C1: call(C2); call(C2); \\n    C2: call(C3); call(C3); \\n    ... \\n    C49: call(C50); call(C50); \\n    C50: (run one step of a program and record the change \\nin storage) \\nNow, send a transaction to A. Thus, in 51 transactions, we have a \\ncontract that takes up 250computational steps. Miners could try to \\ndetect such logic bombs ahead of time by maintaining a value \\nalongside each contract specifying the maximum number of \\ncomputational steps that it can take, and calculating this for \\ncontracts calling other contracts recursively, but that would require \\nminers to forbid contracts that create other contracts (since the \\ncreation and execution of all 26 contracts above could easily be \\nrolled into a single contract). Another problematic point is that the \\naddress field of a message is a variable, so in general it may not \\neven be possible to tell which other contracts a given contract will \\ncall ahead of time. Hence, all in all, we have a surprising \\nconclusion: Turing-completeness is surprisingly easy to manage, \\nand the lack of Turing-completeness is equally surprisingly difficult \\nto manage unless the exact same controls are in place - but in that \\ncase why not just let the protocol be Turing-complete?\\n\\n\\n\\ni. Currency And Issuance\\nThe Ethereum network includes its own built-in currency, ether, \\nwhich serves the dual purpose of providing a primary liquidity layer \\nto allow for efficient exchange between various types of digital \\nassets and, more importantly, of providing a mechanism for paying \\ntransaction fees. For convenience and to avoid future argument \\n(see the current mBTC/uBTC/satoshi debate in Bitcoin), the \\ndenominations will be pre-labelled:\\nâ€¢ 1: wei\\nâ€¢ 1012: szabo\\nâ€¢ 1015: finney\\nâ€¢ 1018: ether\\n\\nThis should be taken as an expanded version of the concept of \\n\"dollars\" and \"cents\" or \"BTC\" and \"satoshi\". In the near future, we \\nexpect \"ether\" to be used for ordinary transactions, \"finney\" for \\nmicrotransactions and \"szabo\" and \"wei\" for technical discussions \\naround fees and protocol implementation; the remaining \\ndenominations may become useful later and should not be included \\nin clients at this point.\\nThe issuance model will be as follows:\\n\\nâ€¢ Ether will be released in a currency sale at the price of \\n1000-2000 ether per BTC, a mechanism intended to fund the \\nEthereum organization and pay for development that has been \\nused with success by other platforms such as Mastercoin and \\nNXT. Earlier buyers will benefit from larger discounts. The BTC \\nreceived from the sale will be used entirely to pay salaries and \\nbounties to developers and invested into various for-profit and \\nnon-profit projects in the Ethereum and cryptocurrency \\necosystem.\\n\\nâ€¢ 0.099x the total amount sold (60102216 ETH) will be allocated \\nto the organization to compensate early contributors and pay \\nETH-denominated expenses before the genesis block.\\n\\nâ€¢ 0.099x the total amount sold will be maintained as a long-term \\nreserve.\\n\\nâ€¢ 0.26x the total amount sold will be allocated to miners per year \\nforever after that point.\\n\\n\\n\\n| Group | At launch | After 1 year | After 5 years | ------------- | \\n------------- |-------------| ----------- | | Currency units | 1.198X | 1.458X | \\n2.498X | | Purchasers | 83.5% | 68.6% | 40.0% | | Reserve spent \\npre-sale | 8.26% | 6.79% | 3.96% | | Reserve used post-sale | 8.26% \\n| 6.79% | 3.96% | | Miners | 0% | 17.8% | 52.0% |\\n\\nâ—¦ Long-Term Supply Growth Rate (percent)**\\n![SPV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/\\nGitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/inflation.png)\\n_Despite the linear currency issuance, just like with Bitcoin over \\ntime the supply growth rate nevertheless tends to zero_\\n\\nThe two main choices in the above model are (1) the existence and \\nsize of an endowment pool, and (2) the existence of a permanently \\ngrowing linear supply, as opposed to a capped supply as in Bitcoin. \\nThe justification of the endowment pool is as follows. If the \\nendowment pool did not exist, and the linear issuance reduced to \\n0.217x to provide the same inflation rate, then the total quantity of \\nether would be 16.5% less and so each unit would be 19.8% more \\nvaluable. Hence, in the equilibrium 19.8% more ether would be \\npurchased in the sale, so each unit would once again be exactly as \\nvaluable as before. The organization would also then have 1.198x \\nas much BTC, which can be considered to be split into two slices: \\nthe original BTC, and the additional 0.198x. Hence, this situation is \\n_exactly equivalent_ to the endowment, but with one important \\ndifference: the organization holds purely BTC, and so is not \\nincentivized to support the value of the ether unit.\\n\\nThe permanent linear supply growth model reduces the risk of what \\nsome see as excessive wealth concentration in Bitcoin, and gives \\nindividuals living in present and future eras a fair chance to acquire \\ncurrency units, while at the same time retaining a strong incentive to \\nobtain and hold ether because the \"supply growth rate\" as a \\npercentage still tends to zero over time. We also theorize that \\nbecause coins are always lost over time due to carelessness, \\ndeath, etc, and coin loss can be modeled as a percentage of the \\ntotal supply per year, that the total currency supply in circulation will \\nin fact eventually stabilize at a value equal to the annual issuance \\ndivided by the loss rate (eg. at a loss rate of 1%, once the supply \\n\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/inflation.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/inflation.png\\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereumbuilders/GitBook/master/en/vitalik-diagrams/inflation.png\\n\\n\\nreaches 26X then 0.26X will be mined and 0.26X lost every year, \\ncreating an equilibrium).\\n\\nNote that in the future, it is likely that Ethereum will switch to a \\nproof-of-stake model for security, reducing the issuance \\nrequirement to somewhere between zero and 0.05X per year. In the \\nevent that the Ethereum organization loses funding or for any other \\nreason disappears, we leave open a \"social contract\": anyone has \\nthe right to create a future candidate version of Ethereum, with the \\nonly condition being that the quantity of ether must be at most equal \\nto `60102216 * (1.198 + 0.26 * n)` where `n` is the number of years \\nafter the genesis block. Creators are free to crowd-sell or otherwise \\nassign some or all of the difference between the PoS-driven supply \\nexpansion and the maximum allowable supply expansion to pay for \\ndevelopment. Candidate upgrades that do not comply with the \\nsocial contract may justifiably be forked into compliant versions.\\n\\ni. Mining Centralization\\nThe Bitcoin mining algorithm works by having miners compute \\nSHA256 on slightly modified versions of the block header millions of \\ntimes over and over again, until eventually one node comes up with \\na version whose hash is less than the target (currently around 2192). \\nHowever, this mining algorithm is vulnerable to two forms of \\ncentralization. First, the mining ecosystem has come to be \\ndominated by ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), \\ncomputer chips designed for, and therefore thousands of times \\nmore efficient at, the specific task of Bitcoin mining. This means that \\nBitcoin mining is no longer a highly decentralized and egalitarian \\npursuit, requiring millions of dollars of capital to effectively \\nparticipate in. Second, most Bitcoin miners do not actually perform \\nblock validation locally; instead, they rely on a centralized mining \\npool to provide the block headers. This problem is arguably worse: \\nas of the time of this writing, the top three mining pools indirectly \\ncontrol roughly 50% of processing power in the Bitcoin network, \\nalthough this is mitigated by the fact that miners can switch to other \\nmining pools if a pool or coalition attempts a 51% attack.\\nThe current intent at Ethereum is to use a mining algorithm where \\nminers are required to fetch random data from the state, compute \\n\\n\\n\\nsome randomly selected transactions from the last N blocks in the \\nblockchain, and return the hash of the result. This has two important \\nbenefits. First, Ethereum contracts can include any kind of \\ncomputation, so an Ethereum ASIC would essentially be an ASIC \\nfor general computation - ie. a better CPU. Second, mining requires \\naccess to the entire blockchain, forcing miners to store the entire \\nblockchain and at least be capable of verifying every transaction. \\nThis removes the need for centralized mining pools; although \\nmining pools can still serve the legitimate role of evening out the \\nrandomness of reward distribution, this function can be served \\nequally well by peer-to-peer pools with no central control.\\n\\nThis model is untested, and there may be difficulties along the way \\nin avoiding certain clever optimizations when using contract \\nexecution as a mining algorithm. However, one notably interesting \\nfeature of this algorithm is that it allows anyone to \"poison the well\", \\nby introducing a large number of contracts into the blockchain \\nspecifically designed to stymie certain ASICs. The economic \\nincentives exist for ASIC manufacturers to use such a trick to attack \\neach other. Thus, the solution that we are developing is ultimately \\nan adaptive economic human solution rather than purely a technical \\none.\\n\\ni. Scalability\\nOne common concern about Ethereum is the issue of scalability. \\nLike Bitcoin, Ethereum suffers from the flaw that every transaction \\nneeds to be processed by every node in the network. With Bitcoin, \\nthe size of the current blockchain rests at about 15 GB, growing by \\nabout 1 MB per hour. If the Bitcoin network were to process Visa\\'s \\n2000 transactions per second, it would grow by 1 MB per three \\nseconds (1 GB per hour, 8 TB per year). Ethereum is likely to suffer \\na similar growth pattern, worsened by the fact that there will be \\nmany applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain instead of just \\na currency as is the case with Bitcoin, but ameliorated by the fact \\nthat Ethereum full nodes need to store just the state instead of the \\nentire blockchain history.\\nThe problem with such a large blockchain size is centralization risk. \\nIf the blockchain size increases to, say, 100 TB, then the likely \\n\\n\\n\\nscenario would be that only a very small number of large \\nbusinesses would run full nodes, with all regular users using light \\nSPV nodes. In such a situation, there arises the potential concern \\nthat the full nodes could band together and all agree to cheat in \\nsome profitable fashion (eg. change the block reward, give \\nthemselves BTC). Light nodes would have no way of detecting this \\nimmediately. Of course, at least one honest full node would likely \\nexist, and after a few hours information about the fraud would trickle \\nout through channels like Reddit, but at that point it would be too \\nlate: it would be up to the ordinary users to organize an effort to \\nblacklist the given blocks, a massive and likely infeasible \\ncoordination problem on a similar scale as that of pulling off a \\nsuccessful 51% attack. In the case of Bitcoin, this is currently a \\nproblem, but there exists a blockchain modification [suggested]\\n(https://web.archive.org/web/20140623061815/http://\\nsourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/31709140/) which will \\nalleviate this issue.\\n\\nIn the near term, Ethereum will use two additional strategies to cope \\nwith this problem. First, because of the blockchain-based mining \\nalgorithms, at least every miner will be forced to be a full node, \\ncreating a lower bound on the number of full nodes. Second and \\nmore importantly, however, we will include an intermediate state \\ntree root in the blockchain after processing each transaction. Even if \\nblock validation is centralized, as long as one honest verifying node \\nexists, the centralization problem can be circumvented via a \\nverification protocol. If a miner publishes an invalid block, that block \\nmust either be badly formatted, or the state `S[n]` is incorrect. Since \\n`S[0]` is known to be correct, there must be some first state `S[i]` \\nthat is incorrect where `S[i-1]` is correct. The verifying node would \\nprovide the index `i`, along with a \"proof of invalidity\" consisting of \\nthe subset of Patricia tree nodes needing to process \\n`APPLY(S[i-1],TX[i]) -> S[i]`. Nodes would be able to use those \\nPatricia nodes to run that part of the computation, and see that the \\n`S[i]` generated does not match the `S[i]` provided.\\n\\nAnother, more sophisticated, attack would involve the malicious \\nminers publishing incomplete blocks, so the full information does \\n\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140623061815/http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/31709140/\\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20140623061815/http://sourceforge.net/p/bitcoin/mailman/message/31709140/\\n\\n\\nnot even exist to determine whether or not blocks are valid. The \\nsolution to this is a challenge-response protocol: verification nodes \\nissue \"challenges\" in the form of target transaction indices, and \\nupon receiving a node a light node treats the block as untrusted \\nuntil another node, whether the miner or another verifier, provides a \\nsubset of Patricia nodes as a proof of validity.\\n\\n1. Conclusion\\nThe Ethereum protocol was originally conceived as an upgraded \\nversion of a cryptocurrency, providing advanced features such as \\non-blockchain escrow, withdrawal limits, financial contracts, \\ngambling markets and the like via a highly generalized \\nprogramming language. The Ethereum protocol would not \"support\" \\nany of the applications directly, but the existence of a Turing-\\ncomplete programming language means that arbitrary contracts can \\ntheoretically be created for any transaction type or application. \\nWhat is more interesting about Ethereum, however, is that the \\nEthereum protocol moves far beyond just currency. Protocols \\naround decentralized file storage, decentralized computation and \\ndecentralized prediction markets, among dozens of other such \\nconcepts, have the potential to substantially increase the efficiency \\nof the computational industry, and provide a massive boost to other \\npeer-to-peer protocols by adding for the first time an economic \\nlayer. Finally, there is also a substantial array of applications that \\nhave nothing to do with money at all.\\nThe concept of an arbitrary state transition function as implemented \\nby the Ethereum protocol provides for a platform with unique \\npotential; rather than being a closed-ended, single-purpose protocol \\nintended for a specific array of applications in data storage, \\ngambling or finance, Ethereum is open-ended by design, and we \\nbelieve that it is extremely well-suited to serving as a foundational \\nlayer for a very large number of both financial and non-financial \\nprotocols in the years to come.\\n\\n1. Notes and Further Reading\\ni. Notes\\n\\n1. A sophisticated reader may notice that in fact a Bitcoin address is \\nthe hash of the elliptic curve public key, and not the public key itself. \\n\\n\\n\\nHowever, it is in fact perfectly legitimate cryptographic terminology \\nto refer to the pubkey hash as a public key itself. This is because \\nBitcoin\\'s cryptography can be considered to be a custom digital \\nsignature algorithm, where the public key consists of the hash of the \\nECC pubkey, the signature consists of the ECC pubkey \\nconcatenated with the ECC signature, and the verification algorithm \\ninvolves checking the ECC pubkey in the signature against the ECC \\npubkey hash provided as a public key and then verifying the ECC \\nsignature against the ECC pubkey. 2. Technically, the median of the \\n11 previous blocks. 3. The Ethereum protocol should be as simple \\nas practical, but it may be necessary to have quite a high level of \\ncomplexity, for instance to scale, to internalize costs of storage, \\nbandwidth and I/O, for security, privacy, transparency, etc. Where \\ncomplexity is necessary, documentation should be as clear, concise \\nand up-to-date as possible, so that someone completely \\nunschooled in Ethereum can learn it and become an expert. 4. See \\nthe [Yellow](https://ethereum.github.io/yellowpaper/paper.pdf) for \\nthe Ethereum Virtual Machine (which is useful as a specification \\nand as a reference for building an Ethereum client from scratch), \\nwhile also there are many topics in the [Ethereum](https://\\ngithub.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki), such as sharding developmment, \\ncore development, dapp development, research, Casper R&D, and \\nnetworking protocols. For research and possible future \\nimplementation there is [ethresear.ch](https://ethresear.ch). 5. \\nAnother way of expressing this is abstraction. The [latest](https://\\nethresear.ch/t/sharding-phase-1-spec/1407/67) is planning to \\nabstract execution, allowing execution engines to not necessarily \\nhave to follow one canonical specification, but for instance it could \\nbe tailored for a specific application, as well as a shard. (This \\nheterogeneity of execution engines is not explicitly stated in the \\nroadmap. There is also heterogeneous sharding, which Vlad Zamfir \\nconceptualized.) 6. Internally, 2 and \"CHARLIE\" are both numbers, \\nwith the latter being in big-endian base 256 representation. \\nNumbers can be at least 0 and at most 2256-1.\\n\\ni. Further Reading\\n1.
