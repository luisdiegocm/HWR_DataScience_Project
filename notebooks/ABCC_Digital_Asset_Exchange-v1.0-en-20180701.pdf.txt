Our Vision 

Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous “creator” of Bitcoin, published his Bitcoin 
White Paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” in 2008 and 
subsequently mined the Genesis Block in 2009. Vitalik Buterin launched Ethereum, 
which can execute smart contracts, in 2015. Blockchain technology has been 
disrupting a wide range of industries at an exponential speed.  

Decentralized and distributed, blockchain technology is offering us fundamentally 
different solutions to many problems. It helps build trust and consensus based on 
cryptography rather than relying on a trusted central party so that economic 
activities can take place and capital can flow across borders frictionlessly. As 
blockchain-based asset digitalization is becoming a new trend, more and more 
investors are adding digital assets to their investment portfolios. There is increasing 
consensus to democratize the digital economy so that everyone can participate and 
enjoy the benefits brought about by blockchain technology.  

ABCC aims to build and nurture a blockchain-enabled digital asset platform. We 
endeavor to build bridges between digital asset users, developers and investors to 
facilitate effective information flow and value creation. We seek to help visionary 
digital asset investors achieve their investment objectives and assist promising 
blockchain project teams secure funding and gain market recognition by providing 
select digital assets, designing and operating innovative digital assets, and investing 
in and supporting blockchain projects with high growth potential. Ultimately, our goal 
is to promote a healthy and sustainable growth of the blockchain industry.

1. Background 

1.1 Opportunities 

Since its inception, the internet has facilitated information flow and sharing by 
establishing a wide and efficient network. Built on top of the internet and as an 
upgrade, blockchain technology has established a decentralized trust as opposed to 
a centralized one. It has enabled tamper-resistant record keeping and distributed 
information storage and sharing by integrating advanced cryptography and database 
technologies.  

As a unique financing solution and a native part of most blockchain projects, 
cryptocurrency has experienced rapid growth both in terms of its overall market 
capitalization and its variety. Subsequently, mainstream investors, both individual 
and institutional, are increasingly including cryptocurrencies as part of their 
investment portfolios.  

Serving as a key part of the digital asset ecosystem, digital asset exchanges connect 
different stakeholders, e.g., blockchain project teams, investors, and advisors, to 
optimize the resource allocation in this growing industry.  

We aim to contribute to the healthy and sustainable growth of the blockchain 
ecosystem. Optimistic about the potentials of digital asset exchanges, we endeavor 
to build and nurture long-term trusting relationships with visionary investors, project 
teams, and other stakeholders in the blockchain ecosystem.  

1.2 Pain Points to be Addressed 

1.2.1 A Lack of Prudent Digital Asset Evaluation Frameworks 

Albeit fast growing, the blockchain industry is still in its infancy with numerous 
emerging projects and cryptocurrencies. While some of these projects are truly 
disruptive, some are merely concepts or even scams.  

As it is an emerging and burgeoning industry, there is a lack of generally accepted 
evaluation frameworks for digital assets. With a relatively limited understanding of 

� /�3 13



blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, retail investors have been exposed to 
high risks.  

While there are more and more digital asset exchanges, not many of them have 
adopted a clear and systematic approach towards digital asset evaluation. With 
sometimes lucrative listing fees, some digital asset listing decisions have been made 
from a commercial point of view rather than based on the quality of the assets itself. 
Hence, it is increasingly pressing and challenging to ensure that only select high-
quality digital assets are presented and provided to investors.  

1.2.2 A Shortage of Variety for Digital Assets 

Compared with traditional financial instruments, there is a shortage of variety for 
blockchain native digital assets. More sophisticated investment vehicles such as 
margin trading, investment portfolios, futures, options and other asset-backed 
securities based on cryptocurrencies, are still nascent. 

As the digital asset industry grows and gradually matures, some of the world’s 
leading digital asset exchanges are rolling out their crypto derivative products on top 
of their mainstream crypto trading offerings. However, financial derivatives are 
complex in design and risky in nature. Only finance professionals with a rich 
experience in derivatives are capable of successfully designing and operating such 
products. Meanwhile, systems and procedures have to be deployed to ensure the 
safety and security of digital asset trading platforms so that investors’ interests are 
safeguarded.  

1.2.3 Security Issues 

Along with a lack of prudent digital asset evaluation frameworks and a shortage of 
variety for digital assets, security is another issue of top concern for investors.  

On the one hand, security is still a challenging issue for blockchains on the 
infrastructure layer. Cryptocurrencies may suffer from different attacks such as “51% 
Attack”, threatening the integrity of and the foundation upon which the trust and 
consensus of blockchain technology are built. For example, Verge, a cryptocurrency 
for users who value security and privacy, suffered from a “51% attack” due to a bug in 

� /�4 13



its codes. As a consequence, its price dropped by 15% within 24 hours after the 
attack.  

On the other hand, cybersecurity incidents at digital asset exchanges happen every 
now and then. Mt. Gox, a cryptocurrency exchange based in Japan and the then 
biggest one in the world, was hacked in March 2014 and as a result, Bitcoin worth 
some $473 million at the time—and representing 7% of all Bitcoins then in existence
—had disappeared. On June 22nd, 2018, the exchange was finally allowed to swap 
bankruptcy proceedings to civil rehabilitation. Similarly, digital assets equaling $31 
million was hacked from Bithumb, a cryptocurrency exchange based in South Korea.  

Cybersecurity practices at a digital asset exchange are based on both of its 
technological and operational capabilities and are demanding for both. According to 
“2017 Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study” by Cambridge Judge Business 
School, there are a few key findings on exchanges’ security practices.  

• On average, security headcount corresponds to 13% of total employees; 17% of the 
budget is spent on security; 

• 80% of large exchanges and 69% of small exchanges use external security providers;  

• Optional two-factor authentication (2FA) is offered to customers by a majority of 
exchanges and required for employees for most operations;  

• 79% of exchanges provide regular security training programs to their staff; 

• 92% of exchanges use cold-storage systems; on average 87% of funds are kept in cold 
storage; 

• Multi-signature architecture is supported by 86% of large exchanges and 76% of small 
exchanges； 

• 60% of large exchanges have external parties performing their formal security audits, 
while 65% of small exchanges perform them internally.

2. Our Business 

With blockchain technology disrupting a wide range of industries, ABCC is well 
positioned to solve the pain points and challenges presented and elaborated above. 
We endeavor to provide a secure and convenient digital asset exchange platform 
with our proven technological and operational capabilities.  

2.1 Business Model 

2.1.1 Digital Asset Evaluation Framework 

ABCC aims to build and nurture a blockchain-based digital asset exchange. We 
endeavor to build bridges between digital asset users, developers and investors to 
enable effective information flow and value creation. We will help visionary digital 
asset investors obtain risk-adjusted returns and grow their assets. At the core of this 
ecosystem is our proprietary digital asset evaluation framework.  

We assess prospective digital assets with our proprietary multi-dimensional 
evaluation framework. Before reaching an asset listing decision, we will 
comprehensively assess factors such as product/services, industry attractiveness, 
competition, regulations, team, technology and operations, crypto economics, 
liquidity, community, and others.  

2.1.2 Digital Asset Innovation 

By leveraging our deep and broad experience in financial innovation, we will gradually 
roll out our innovative digital asset offerings to enable our users to optimize their 
digital asset allocation and manage their risk exposures. Once we have obtained 
relevant licenses and permissions, we plan to provide various innovative digital asset 
products such as margin trading and contract trading.  

Users can enter an order to borrow a desirable amount of funding from us so that 
they can raise their trading positions with leverage. Likewise, users will have the 
option of borrowing digital assets from us and selling them when they deem the 

� /�6 13



price to be high. They can buy back the assets and repay us when the price reverts 
to a healthy level.  

We will help our users to achieve their investment objectives flexibly by offering 
digital asset futures and options. On one hand, this will offer hedging tools to our 
users to manage the risk exposures of their current digital asset positions. On the 
other hand, this will enable our users to exploit investment opportunities presented 
in the mispricing of certain digital assets based on their judgments. Ultimately, we 
will help investors achieve their optimal risk-adjusted investment returns. 

Further, by investing in investment portfolios and other asset-backed securities 
based on cryptocurrencies, users can achieve their optimal risk-adjusted returns with 
the help of professional digital asset analysis and portfolio construction.  

At the same time, we have rigorous systems and procedures to ensure the safety and 
security of our digital asset trading platform so that investors’ interests are 
safeguarded.  

2.1.3 Early-stage Blockchain Project Investment and Incubation 

We plan to take an active role in early-stage blockchain projects by making strategic 
investments and providing incubation and enabling services. This will help projects 
with high growth potential to secure funding and gain market recognition while 
providing premium investment opportunities to our users.  

2.1.4 Features 

We aim to provide a wide range of blockchain native digital assets and other related 
services.  

Crypto Trading 

One of our core product offerings is crypto trading. We select our listed digital 
assets with our proprietary multi-dimensional digital asset assessment framework 
and ensure that they are presented in a visually friendly way. In this way, our users 
can achieve their investment objectives efficiently. 

� /�7 13



Fiat Trading 

Once we have obtained relevant licenses and permissions, we plan to roll out fiat 
trading services to our users. This will further improve and optimize our secure and 
seamless trading services.  

Margin Trading 

Once we have obtained relevant licenses and permissions, we plan to provide margin 
trading services to our users. With leverage, our users will be able to achieve more 
efficient and flexible asset allocation.  

Contract Trading 

Once we have obtained relevant licenses and permissions, we plan to roll out 
contract trading services to our users, e.g., futures, options, investment portfolios 
and other asset-backed securities based on cryptocurrencies. This will enable digital 
asset investors to manage their risk exposure and obtain risk-adjusted returns.  

OTC (Over the Counter) 

We actively trade on mainstream digital asset exchanges and provide block trading 
services over the counter. Our trading partners include Ultra High Net Worth 
Individuals, family offices, mining businesses, hedge funds and other traditional 
financial institutions.  

Value-added Services 

We will leverage our knowledge and expertise in blockchain technology and digital 
assets to provide value-added services to facilitate our users’ informed investment 
decision-making. Our value-added services will include but are not limited to news 
push, asset allocation services, and other self-services.  

Devices 

We will offer our digital asset trading services across multiple devices and platforms, 
including PC Web, Mobile HTML5, iOS, Android, and others.  

� /�8 13



2.1.5 Technical Architecture and Trading Environment 

High-Performance Matching Engine 

Our exchange platform has adopted a pure in-memory matching technology, with 
which a single machine can facilitate millions of simultaneous matchings. With 
cluster-sharding, this number can be further increased to over 10 million so that 
efficient low-latency matching can be a reality.  

Meanwhile, our technical architecture is highly stable with hot failover based on our 
experience and proven track record at BAT, i.e., Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent.  

Extendable Multiple Trading Order Architecture 

Our order fulfillment is highly extendable, capable of efficiently dealing with a 
variety of trading order fulfilment (FOK, IOC, etc.). This enables us to provide a 
professional trading environment for professional traders. This extendable trading 
order architecture even has the potential to form an ecosystem, available to a wide 
range of users, including professional financial services providers. 

Shard-able Trading Server Cluster 

Our trading platform is based on a mature technical architecture with multilayer 
clustering. It is well-structured to handle high concurrency trading and process a 
massive amount of information and data.  

Meanwhile, we have used extensively Cloud Native compliant frameworks and 
infrastructures so that our system can be turned into a sharding structure. This has 
enabled our system to handle a massive trading volume. The maximum trading 
volume that our system can handle is only dependent on the scale of the server 
cluster.  

Near Real-Time Clearing System 

Clearing system is one of the most critical components of a digital asset exchange. 
We have developed our proprietary asset management system to enable 
synchronized on-chain and off-chain asset management.  

Also, with our multi-layer data architecture, our proprietary clearing system has 
made near real-time clearing a reality.  

� /�9 13



Security Architecture 

Capital safety and information security of our users are amongst our paramount 
concerns. Our security architecture includes a separation of hot wallets and cold 
wallets, multi-signature security, two-factor authentication and others. 

2.1.6 Capital Safety and Risk Management 

Capital Safety 

We have separated our clearing process from our trading platform and have adopted 
near real-time clearing to ensure the safety of funds on our platform. Meanwhile, we 
can focus on the optimization of the matching engine of our trading platform.  

Account Security 

With our account security system based on big data and artificial intelligence (AI), 
we continuously assess and ensure account security and compliance.  

Withdrawal Services 

By leveraging big data, AI, and the flexibility offered by human services, our 
withdrawal services are highly secure, efficient and flexible.  

Security Audit 

We are working in collaboration with industry-leading cybersecurity companies in the 
blockchain industry to regularly assess our IT systems.
