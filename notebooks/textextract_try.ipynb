      "in the context of privacy, transparency, and user control of data. In 2018, as we dove deeper into our \n",

      "\n",
      "The speed of a transaction is ultimately determined by when that transaction is fully processed and confirmed, also known as finality. \n",
      "\n",
      "These are the definitions of finality:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Steady-state block finality is based on the rate at which a finalized block is created every block generation round, and can\n",
      "\n",
      "be directly correlated with transactions per second. So, if the block size averages 1000 transactions, and steady-state finality is \n",
      "\n",
      "a second, then the transactions per second (TPS) is 1000. \n",
      "\n",
      "2) End-to-end block finality is defined as the time taken from the generation of a block to the finalization of that block; this\n",
      "\n",
      "timeframe is typically about two to three times that of steady-state finality. \n",
      "\n",
      "3) Transaction finality is based on the time the transaction is sent by the user, to the miner, to the time a block with that\n",
      "\n",
      "transaction is finalized. Transaction finality is typically longer than block finality by about a 1.5 to 2 times multiple, because the \n",
      "\n",
      "transaction depends on the internet speed quality of the end user. Even if the connection is perfect, the transaction submitted \n",
      "\n",
      "could miss the block generation event. In our experiments, which included 130 world-wide nodes (100 miners, 30 sharders) with \n",
      "\n",
      "an average network latency of 700 ms, the steady-state finality was roughly ~1.2s, block finality was ~4.6s, and transaction \n",
      "\n",
      "finality was ~5.4s. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "be about 200ms. Additionally, if the transactions are less than 100 per block, the steady-state finality would clock in at 300ms, with \n",

      "The following observations have been made based on the aforementioned results:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. No rounds with 4-notarized blocks were observed in any of the scenarios.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. With static block proposal wait time, the steady state finality increases little from 1238.57 ms to 1267.28 ms when the wait time\n",
      "\n",
      "increases from 200 to 400 but increases much higher to 1424.32 when the wait time is 800. When the wait time is too short, it is still\n",
      "\n",
      "required to wait to receive the first block. So, there is a minimum built-in wait time. Hence, any block proposal wait time below this\n",
      "\n",
      "minimum wait time will not reduce the stead state finality. Similarly, any wait above the time when all blocks are received will result in\n",
      "\n",
      "delaying the verification process and hence directly contribute to the rond processing time, Tr.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. As the static wait time increased, the percent of rounds with single notarized blocks increased showing very high percent at 800 ms\n",
      "\n",
      "wait confirming that majority of the nodes are able to send a block within this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Increase of the finality wait time (Tfw) from 400 to 1200 didn’t impact the steady state finality much by only increasing it from 1238.57\n",
      "\n",
      "to 1251.13. This is expected because, as long as the finality wait time is less than, Tr, the time between two successive rounds, the\n",
      "\n",
      "steady state finality only depends on Tr. Since, Tr is 1238.57 when the finality time was 400, increasing it to 1200 didn’t significantly\n",
      "\n",
      "increase the steady state finality.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. However, increase in Tfw, does increase the start to finish block finality linearly. For example, the finality increased from 4497.22ms to\n",
      "\n",
      "5338.80ms and 4497.22+3*(1251.13-1238.57)+(1200-400) = 5334.90 which is close to the observed value of 5338.80 and agrees\n",
      "\n",
      "with the start to finish finality time formula given above.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. While static wait of 800ms resulted in 99.43% rounds with single notarized blocks, 800ms dynamic wait resulted in only 95.93% but\n",
      "\n",
      "steady state finality reduced from 1424.32ms to 1260.01ms. This is the expected trade-off between improving finality and ending up\n",
      "\n",
      "with multiple notarized blocks in a round.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Unlike the static wait, steady state finality is not impacted much with increasing the block wait proposal time under dynamic wait. This\n",
      "\n",
      "is again expected because most of the time the wait will be within the median network time and only occasionally it will exceed that\n",
      "\n",
      "but still be the network time of one of the generators that is smaller than the dynamic wait time. Hence, even after increasing the\n",
      "\n",
      "dynamic wait time to 1600ms, the steady state finality hardly had any impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "These experimental results provide valuable insights for us to fine tune the key parameters as needed. In dFinity, the process \n",
      "\n",
      "timings such as block generation and verification times are assumed to be 0. The network time is considered the same for a small \n",

      "\n",
      "The ABLE project has been proposed to provide an alternative to banks’ conventional lending-\n",
      "deposit spread structure, and to solve problems with initial cryptocurrency banking services.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) Banks have a business model based on a lending-deposit spread (i.e., the difference between \n",
      "lending and deposit interest rates), in which the bank acts as an intermediary between depositors \n",
      "and borrowers. This structure allows banks to receive deposits at low interest rates and lend \n",
      "money at high rates, profiting from the difference.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2) Existing cryptocurrency-based banking services are provided through a centralized structure. \n",
      "The combination of unsustainably high interest rates and centralized services renders banks \n",
      "directly vulnerable to managers’ moral hazard and the hacking of central servers. The lack of \n",
      "integrated solutions in the crypto market withholds users from experiencing diverse banking \n",
      "services.\n",

      "The ABLE project aims to solve these problems by applying decentralized blockchain technology. \n",
      "\n",
      "By developing a matching engine that connects investors and borrowers on a peer-to-peer \n",
      "basis, the project directly connects investors and borrowers without any intermediaries. With \n",
      "intermediaries and lending spreads eliminated, cryptocurrency interest rates will be determined \n",
      "by mutual agreement between users in a free market, and said rates will serve as market interest \n",
      "rates. Investors can receive higher interests than they would in a centralized market, while \n",
      "borrowers can lend money at lower rates, creating a win-win scenario. Since investing and \n",
      "lending occur governed by smart contracts, the project will eliminate exposure to managers’ \n",
      "moral hazard and the risk of central-server hacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current cryptocurrency banking services provide deposits and loans separately rather than \n",
      "linking depositors and borrowers. The services have shortcomings such as inability to provide \n",
      "high deposit interest rates in a sustainable way. Such services cannot mitigate or eliminate \n",
      "intermediary risks because their structure is based on a centralized model. On the other hand, the \n",

      "activities such as payroll and investment, based on smart contracts. \n",
      "\n",
      "The ABLE project primarily aims to apply decentralized blockchain technology to financial and \n",

      "\n",
      "The promise of advertising technology (“ad-tech”) was to create a more efficient\n",

      "\n",
      "In theory, excellence would be rewarded. The best journalism and entertainment\n",
      "would receive the attention and funding it deserved. Ad tech would “get marketers\n",
      "closer to their users via data analysis, immediate valuation and distribution.” Data\n",
      "would be used to “accurately identify audiences, determine the value of those audiences,\n",
      "and deliver the right messages to them instantly.”[1] In short, users’ attention would be\n",
      "valued properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "That didn’t happen. Instead, the ad-tech ecosystem that has evolved over the last\n",
      "two decades is a bewildering variety of middlemen and complexity. Worse, ad-tech\n",
      "introduced a host of correlated problems for publishers, advertisers and users. Users\n",
      "have lost their privacy, face increasing malware, pay high charges to download ads, and\n",
      "suffer slow speeds. Publishers have lost billions in revenue while fraud has skyrocketed.\n",
      "And advertisers face poor reporting and targeting.\n",

      "\n",
      "Problems involving social and transactions costs have been studied by economists.\n",

      "\n",
      "The widespread adoption of ad blocking technology adds a negative externality on\n",
      "the publishers as well. If everyone blocked advertisements, there would be little content\n",
      "left to exchange for user attention, as publishers go out of business. An efficient market\n",
      "for attention would remove these negative externalities, or compensate all parties to the\n",
      "transaction in an efficient way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Coase theorem states that trade in an externality or “social cost” is possible.\n",

      "\n",
      "The final requirement, which is only a soft requirement for Coasean analysis in\n",

      "In our view, there are fundamentally two different types of exchanges: the ones that              \n",
      "deal with fiat currency; and the ones that deal purely in crypto. It is the latter one that                  \n",
      "we will focus on. Even though they are small now, we strongly believe that pure               \n",
      "crypto exchanges will be bigger, many times bigger, than fiat based exchanges in the              \n",

      "Problems \n",
      "Some of the current crypto exchanges suffer from a number of problems: \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "● Poor technical architecture \n",
      "Many exchanges are “put together quickly”, by good tech people, but who            \n",
      "have little or no experience in finance or in operating an exchange. They often              \n",
      "choose the simplest approach to get the system up and running. While this             \n",
      "may work well in the beginning, as traffic grows, the system will not able to               \n",
      "handle the increased load. Exchange systems need to be engineered from           \n",
      "the ground up with security, efficiency, speed, and scalability in mind. This            \n",
      "often slows down the initial development, but is critical for long-term success. \n",
      " \n",
      "Our team has decades of combined experience building and maintaining          \n",
      "world class financial systems that shape the economy. We understand how           \n",
      "these systems are built from the ground up. \n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "● Insecure platform \n",
      "There are hundreds of  exchanges that went down due to being hacked . 1\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "Binance is built to high standards, audited, and penetration tested. We have            \n",

      "strive to ensure security first. \n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "● Poor market liquidity \n",
      "\n",
      "Professional traders and normal users are significantly affected by this.          \n",
      "Having a shallow orderbook means high slippage when trading, which is very            \n",
      "expensive for traders. Getting miners, institutional investors and large traders          \n",

      "years. The team has worked on and operated a number of exchanges, and             \n",

      "trader mentality is vital for running a successful exchange. Money is literally            \n",

      "\n",
      " \n",
      "● Poor internationalization and language support \n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as \n",
      "trusted third parties to process electronic payments.  While the system works well enough for \n",
      "most  transactions,  it  still  suffers  from  the  inherent  weaknesses  of  the  trust  based  model. \n",
      "Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot \n",
      "avoid  mediating  disputes.   The  cost  of  mediation  increases  transaction  costs,  limiting  the \n",
      "minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, \n",
      "and  there  is  a  broader  cost  in  the  loss  of  ability  to  make  non-reversible  payments  for  non-\n",
      "reversible services.  With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads.  Merchants must \n",
      "be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. \n",
      "A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable.  These costs and payment uncertainties \n",
      "can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments \n",
      "over a communications channel without a trusted party.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is needed is an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust, \n",
      "allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a trusted \n",
      "third party.  Transactions that are computationally impractical to reverse would protect sellers \n",
      "from fraud, and routine escrow mechanisms could easily be implemented to protect buyers.  In \n",
      "this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed \n",
      "timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions.  The \n",

      "2. Transactions\n",
      "We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures.  Each owner transfers the coin to the \n",
      "next by digitally signing a hash of the previous transaction and the public key of the next owner \n",
      "and adding these to the end of the coin.  A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of \n",
      "ownership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend \n",
      "the coin.  A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every \n",
      "transaction for double spending.  After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to \n",
      "issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. \n",
      "The  problem with  this  solution  is  that  the  fate  of  the  entire  money  system depends  on  the \n",
      "company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need a way for the payee to  know that the  previous owners did not  sign any earlier \n",
      "transactions.  For our purposes, the earliest transaction is the one that counts, so we don't care \n",
      "about later attempts to double-spend.  The only way to confirm the absence of a transaction is to \n",
      "be aware of all transactions.  In the mint based model, the mint was aware of all transactions and \n",
      "decided which arrived first.   To accomplish this without a trusted party, transactions must be \n",
      "publicly announced [1], and we need a system for participants to agree on a single history of the \n",

      "3. Timestamp Server\n",
      "The solution we propose begins with a timestamp server.  A timestamp server works by taking a \n",
      "hash  of  a  block  of  items  to  be  timestamped  and  widely  publishing  the  hash,  such  as  in  a \n",

      "4. Proof-of-Work\n",
      "To implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis, we will need to use a proof-\n",
      "of-work system similar to Adam Back's Hashcash [6], rather than newspaper or Usenet posts. \n",
      "The proof-of-work involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the \n",
      "hash begins with a number of zero bits.  The average work required is exponential in the number \n",
      "of zero bits required and can be verified by executing a single hash.\n",
      "\n",
      "For our timestamp network, we implement the proof-of-work by incrementing a nonce in the \n",
      "block until a value is found that gives the block's hash the required zero bits.  Once the CPU \n",
      "effort  has been expended to make it  satisfy the proof-of-work, the  block cannot  be  changed \n",
      "without redoing the work.  As later blocks are chained after it, the work to change the block \n",
      "would include redoing all the blocks after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority decision \n",
      "making.  If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be subverted by anyone \n",
      "able  to  allocate  many  IPs.   Proof-of-work  is  essentially  one-CPU-one-vote.   The  majority \n",
      "decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested \n",
      "in it.  If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the \n",
      "fastest and outpace any competing chains.  To modify a past block, an attacker would have to \n",
      "redo the proof-of-work of the block and all blocks after it and then catch up with and surpass the \n",
      "work of the honest nodes.  We will show later that the probability of a slower attacker catching up \n",
      "diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.\n",
      "\n",
      "To compensate for increasing hardware speed and varying interest in running nodes over time, \n",
      "the proof-of-work difficulty is determined by a moving average targeting an average number of \n",
      "blocks per hour.  If they're generated too fast, the difficulty increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Network\n",
      "The steps to run the network are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1) New transactions are broadcast to all nodes.\n",
      "2) Each node collects new transactions into a block.  \n",
      "3) Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block.\n",
      "4) When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes.\n",
      "5) Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent.\n",
      "6) Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the \n",
      "\n",
      "chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nodes always consider the longest chain to be the correct one and will keep working on \n",
      "extending it.  If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some \n",
      "nodes may receive one or the other first.  In that case, they work on the first one they received, \n",
      "but save the other branch in case it becomes longer.  The tie will be broken when the next proof-\n",
      "of-work is found and one branch becomes longer;  the nodes that were working on the other \n",
      "branch will then switch to the longer one.\n",

      "many nodes, they will get into a block before long.  Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped \n",
      "messages.  If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and \n",
      "realizes it missed one.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Incentive\n",
      "By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned \n",
      "by the creator of the block.  This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides \n",
      "a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them. \n",
      "The steady addition of a constant of amount of new coins is analogous to gold miners expending \n",
      "resources to add gold to circulation.  In our case, it is CPU time and electricity that is expended.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incentive can also be funded with transaction fees.  If the output value of a transaction is \n",
      "less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of \n",
      "the  block  containing  the  transaction.   Once  a  predetermined  number  of  coins  have  entered \n",
      "circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation \n",
      "free.\n",
      "\n",
      "The incentive  may help  encourage nodes to  stay  honest.   If  a  greedy attacker  is  able  to \n",
      "assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it \n",
      "to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins.  He ought to \n",
      "find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than \n",
      "everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Reclaiming Disk Space\n",
      "Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before \n",
      "it  can be discarded to  save disk  space.   To facilitate  this  without  breaking the  block's  hash, \n",
      "transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash. \n",
      "Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.  The interior hashes do \n",
      "not need to be stored.\n",
      "\n",
      "A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes.   If we suppose blocks are \n",
      "generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year.  With computer systems \n",

      "transaction of this denomination to me\", essentially allowing \n",
      "decentralized cross-cryptocurrency exchange.\n",
      "However, the scripting language as implemented in Bitcoin has \n",
      "several important limitations:\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Lack of Turing-completeness** - that is to say, while there is \n",
      "a large subset of computation that the Bitcoin scripting \n",
      "language supports, it does not nearly support everything. The \n",
      "main category that is missing is loops. This is done to avoid \n",
      "infinite loops during transaction verification; theoretically it is a \n",
      "surmountable obstacle for script programmers, since any loop \n",
      "can be simulated by simply repeating the underlying code \n",
      "many times with an if statement, but it does lead to scripts that \n",
      "are very space-inefficient. For example, implementing an \n",
      "alternative elliptic curve signature algorithm would likely \n",
      "require 256 repeated multiplication rounds all individually \n",
      "included in the code.\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Value-blindness** - there is no way for a UTXO script to \n",
      "provide fine-grained control over the amount that can be \n",
      "withdrawn. For example, one powerful use case of an oracle \n",
      "contract would be a hedging contract, where A and B put in \n",
      "$1000 worth of BTC and after 30 days the script sends $1000 \n",
      "worth of BTC to A and the rest to B. This would require an \n",

      "it is a massive improvement in terms of trust and infrastructure \n",
      "requirement over the fully centralized solutions that are \n",
      "available now. However, because UTXO are all-or-nothing, the \n",
      "only way to achieve this is through the very inefficient hack of \n",
      "having many UTXO of varying denominations (eg. one UTXO \n",

      "send to A and which to B.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "• **Lack of state** - a [UTXO](https://bitcoin.org/en/glossary/\n",
      "unspent-transaction-output); there is no opportunity for multi-\n",
      "stage contracts or scripts which keep any other internal state \n",

      "combined with value-blindness also mean that another \n",
      "important application, withdrawal limits, is impossible.\n",

      "• **Blockchain-blindness** - UTXO are blind to blockchain data \n",

      "\n",
      "i. Token Systems\n",
      "On-blockchain token systems have many applications ranging from \n",
      "sub-currencies representing assets such as USD or gold to \n",
      "company stocks, individual tokens representing smart property, \n",
      "secure unforgeable coupons, and even token systems with no ties \n",

      "i. Financial derivatives and Stable-Value Currencies\n",
      "Financial derivatives are the most common application of a \"smart \n",

      "the volatility of ether (or another cryptocurrency) with respect to the \n",

      "value of ETH/USD is. The simplest way to do this is through a \"data \n",
      "feed\" contract maintained by a specific party (eg. NASDAQ) \n",
      "designed so that that party has the ability to update the contract as \n",
      "needed, and providing an interface that allows other contracts to \n",
      "send a message to that contract and get back a response that \n",
      "provides the price.\n",
      "Given that critical ingredient, the hedging contract would look as \n",
      "follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Wait for party A to input 1000 ether. 2. Wait for party B to input \n",
      "1000 ether. 3. Record the USD value of 1000 ether, calculated by \n",
      "querying the data feed contract, in storage, say this is $x. 4. After \n",
      "30 days, allow A or B to \"reactivate\" the contract in order to send $x \n",
      "worth of ether (calculated by querying the data feed contract again \n",
      "to get the new price) to A and the rest to B.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a contract would have significant potential in crypto-\n",
      "commerce. One of the main problems cited about cryptocurrency is \n",
      "the fact that it's volatile; although many users and merchants may \n",
      "want the security and convenience of dealing with cryptographic \n",
      "assets, they may not wish to face that prospect of losing 23% of the \n",
      "value of their funds in a single day. Up until now, the most \n",
      "commonly proposed solution has been issuer-backed assets; the \n",
      "idea is that an issuer creates a sub-currency in which they have the \n",
      "right to issue and revoke units, and provide one unit of the currency \n",
      "to anyone who provides them (offline) with one unit of a specified \n",
      "underlying asset (eg. gold, USD). The issuer then promises to \n",
      "provide one unit of the underlying asset to anyone who sends back \n",
      "one unit of the crypto-asset. This mechanism allows any non-\n",
      "cryptographic asset to be \"uplifted\" into a cryptographic asset, \n",

      "In practice, however, issuers are not always trustworthy, and in \n",
      "some cases the banking infrastructure is too weak, or too hostile, \n",

      "default on their side of the bargain because the hedging contract \n",
      "holds their funds in escrow. Note that this approach is not fully \n",
      "decentralized, because a trusted source is still needed to provide \n",
      "the price ticker, although arguably even still this is a massive \n",

      "\n",
      "1. A transaction leads to `k` operations, offering the reward `kR` to \n",
      "any miner that includes it where `R` is set by the sender and `k` and \n",

      "processing power (ie. `1/N` of total) 4. No non-mining full nodes \n",
      "exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "A miner would be willing to process a transaction if the expected \n",
      "reward is greater than the cost. Thus, the expected reward is `kR/N` \n",
      "since the miner has a `1/N` chance of processing the next block, \n",
      "and the processing cost for the miner is simply `kC`. Hence, miners \n",
      "will include transactions where `kR/N > kC`, or `R > NC`. Note that \n",
      "`R` is the per-operation fee provided by the sender, and is thus a \n",
      "lower bound on the benefit that the sender derives from the \n",
      "transaction, and `NC` is the cost to the entire network together of \n",

      "\n",
      "However, there are several important deviations from those \n",
      "assumptions in reality:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The miner does pay a higher cost to process the transaction than \n",
      "the other verifying nodes, since the extra verification time delays \n",
      "block propagation and thus increases the chance the block will \n",
      "become a stale. 2. There do exist non-mining full nodes. 3. The \n",

      "\n",
      "In this paper we discuss an innovative approach that does not incorporate blockchain\n",
      "technology. This approach is currently being implemented as a cryptocurrency called\n",
      "iota [1], which was designed specifically for the IoT industry. The purpose of this\n",
      "paper is to focus on general features of the tangle, and to discuss problems that arise\n",
      "when one attempts to get rid of the blockchain and maintain a distributed ledger.\n",
      "The concrete implementation of the iota protocol is not discussed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, a tangle-based cryptocurrency works in the following way. Instead\n",
      "of the global blockchain, there is a DAG that we call the tangle. The transactions\n",
      "issued by nodes constitute the site set of the tangle graph, which is the ledger for\n",
      "storing transactions. The edge set of the tangle is obtained in the following way:\n",
      "when a new transaction arrives, it must approve two1 previous transactions. these\n",
      "approvals are represented by directed edges, as shown in Figure 12. If there is not\n",
      "a directed edge between transaction A and transaction B, but there is a directed\n",
      "path of length at least two from A to B, we say that A indirectly approves B. There\n",
      "is also the “genesis” transaction, which is approved either directly or indirectly by\n",
      "all other transactions (Figure 2). The genesis is described in the following way. In\n",
      "the beginning of the tangle, there was an address with a balance that contained all\n",
      "of the tokens. The genesis transaction sent these tokens to several other “founder”\n",
      "addresses. Let us stress that all of the tokens were created in the genesis transaction.\n",
      "No tokens will be created in the future, and there will be no mining in the sense that\n",
      "miners receive monetary rewards “out of thin air”.\n",
      "\n",
      "A quick note on terminology: sites are transactions represented on the tangle\n",
      "graph. The network is composed of nodes ; that is, nodes are entities that issue and\n",
      "validate transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main idea of the tangle is the following: to issue a transaction, users must\n",
      "work to approve other transactions. Therefore, users who issue a transaction are\n",
      "contributing to the network’s security. It is assumed that the nodes check if the\n",
      "approved transactions are not conflicting. If a node finds that a transaction is in\n",
      "conflict with the tangle history, the node will not approve the conflicting transaction\n",
      "in either a direct or indirect manner3.\n",
      "\n",
      "1This is the simplest approach. One may also study similar systems where transactions must\n",
      "approve k other transactions for a general k ≥ 2, or have an entirely different set of rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "2Time always increases from left to right in each figure.\n",
      "3If a node issues a new transaction that approves conflicting transactions, then it risks that other\n",
      "\n",
      "nodes will not approve its new transaction, which will fall into oblivion.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a transaction receives additional approvals, it is accepted by the system with\n",
      "a higher level of confidence. In other words, it will be difficult to make the system\n",
      "accept a double-spending transaction. It is important to observe that we do not\n",
      "impose any rules for choosing which transactions a node will approve. Instead, we\n",
      "argue that if a large number of nodes follow some “reference” rule, then for any fixed\n",
      "node it is better to stick to a rule of the same kind4. This seems to be a reasonable\n",
      "assumption, especially in the context of IoT, where nodes are specialized chips with\n",
      "pre-installed firmware.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to issue a transaction, a node does the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "• The node chooses two other transactions to approve according to an algorithm.\n",
      "In general, these two transactions may coincide.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The node checks if the two transactions are not conflicting, and does not approve\n",
      "conflicting transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "• For a node to issue a valid transaction, the node must solve a cryptographic\n",
      "puzzle similar to those in the Bitcoin blockchain. This is achieved by finding a\n",
      "nonce such that the hash of that nonce concatenated with some data from the\n",
      "approved transaction has a particular form. In the case of the Bitcoin protocol,\n",
      "the hash must have at least a predefined number of leading zeros.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to observe that the iota network is asynchronous. In general, nodes\n",
      "do not necessarily see the same set of transactions. It should also be noted that\n",
      "the tangle may contain conflicting transactions. The nodes do not have to achieve\n",
      "consensus on which valid5 transactions have the right to be in the ledger, meaning\n",
      "all of them can be in the tangle. However, in the case where there are conflicting\n",
      "transactions, the nodes need to decide which transactions will become orphaned6.\n",
      "The main rule that the nodes use for deciding between two conflicting transactions is\n",
      "the following: a node runs the tip selection algorithm7 (cf. Section 4.1) many times,\n",
      "and sees which of the two transactions is more likely to be indirectly approved by the\n",
      "selected tip. For example, if a transaction was selected 97 times during 100 runs of\n",
      "the tip selection algorithm, we say that it is confirmed with 97% confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us also comment on the following question (cf. [4]): what motivates the nodes\n",
      "to propagate transactions? Every node calculates some statistics, one of which is\n",
      "\n",
      "4We comment more on this at the end of Section 4.1\n",
      "5Transactions that are issued according to the protocol.\n",
      "6Orphaned transactions are not indirectly approved by incoming transactions anymore\n",
      "7As mentioned above, there is a good reason to assume that other nodes would follow the same\n",
      "\n",
      "algorithm for tip selection.\n",
      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "how many new transactions are received from a neighbor. If one particular node is\n",
      "“too lazy”, it will be dropped by its neighbors. Therefore, even if a node does not\n",
      "issue transactions, and hence has no direct incentive to share new transactions that\n",
      "approve its own transaction, it still has incentive to participate.\n",
      "\n",
      "After introducing some notation in Section 2, we discuss algorithms for choosing\n",
      "the two transactions to approve, the rules for measuring the transaction’s overall\n",
      "approval (Section 3, especially Section 3.1), and possible attack scenarios (Section 4).\n",
      "Also, in the unlikely event that the reader is scared by the formulas, they can jump\n",
      "directly to the “conclusions” at the end of each section.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that the idea of using DAGs in the cryptocurrency space\n",
      "has been around for some time, see [3, 6, 7, 9, 12]. Specifically, [7] introduces the\n",
      "GHOST protocol, which proposes a modification of the Bitcoin protocol by making\n",
      "the main ledger a tree instead of a blockchain. It is shown that such a modification\n",
      "reduces confirmation times and improves the overall security of the network. In [9]\n",
      "the authors consider a DAG-based cryptocurrency model. Their model is different\n",
      "than our model for the following reasons: the sites of their DAG are blocks instead of\n",
      "individual transactions; the miners in their system compete for transaction fees; and\n",
      "new tokens may be created by block miners. Also, observe that a solution somewhat\n",
      "similar to ours was proposed in [6], although it does not discuss any particular tip\n",
      "approval strategies. After the first version of this paper was published, several other\n",
      "works that aim to create a DAG-based distributed ledger have appeared, e.g. [8]. We\n",
      "also reference another approach [2, 10] that aims to make Bitcoin micropayments\n",
      "possible by establishing peer-to-peer payment channels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 Weights and more\n",
      "\n",
      "In this section we define the weight of a transaction, and related concepts. The\n",
      "weight of a transaction is proportional to the amount of work that the issuing node\n",
      "invested into it. In the current implementation of iota, the weight may only assume\n",
      "values 3n, where n is a positive integer that belongs to some nonempty interval of\n",
      "acceptable values8. In fact, it is irrelevant to know how the weight was obtained in\n",
      "practice. It is only important that every transaction has a positive integer, its weight,\n",
      "attached to it. In general, the idea is that a transaction with a larger weight is more\n",
      "“important” than a transaction with a smaller weight. To avoid spamming and other\n",
      "attack styles, it is assumed that no entity can generate an abundance of transactions\n",
      "with “acceptable” weights in a short period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "8This interval should also be finite — see the “large weight attack” in Section 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the notions we need is the cumulative weight of a transaction: it is defined\n",
      "as the own weight of a particular transaction plus the sum of own weights of all\n",
      "transactions that directly or indirectly approve this transaction. The algorithm for\n",
      "cumulative weight calculation is illustrated in Figure 1. The boxes represent trans-\n",
      "actions, the small number in the SE corner of each box denotes own weight, and the\n",
      "bold number denotes the cumulative weight. For example, transaction F is directly\n",
      "or indirectly approved by transactions A,B,C,E. The cumulative weight of F is\n",
      "9 = 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1, which is the sum of the own weight of F and the own weights\n",
      "of A,B,C,E.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us define “tips” as unapproved transactions in the tangle graph. In the top\n",
      "tangle snapshot of Figure 1, the only tips are A and C. When the new transaction X\n",
      "arrives and approves A and C in the bottom tangle snapshot, X becomes the only\n",
      "tip. The cumulative weight of all other transactions increases by 3, the own weight\n",
      "of X.\n",
      "\n",
      "We need to introduce two additional variables for the discussion of approval algo-\n",
      "rithms. First, for a transaction site on the tangle, we introduce its\n",
      "\n",
      "• height : the length of the longest oriented path to the genesis;\n",
      "\n",
      "• depth: the length of the longest reverse-oriented path to some tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, G has height 1 and depth 4 in Figure 2 because of the reverse path\n",
      "F,D,B,A, while D has height 3 and depth 2. Also, let us introduce the notion of\n",
      "the score. By definition, the score of a transaction is the sum of own weights of\n",
      "all transactions approved by this transaction plus the own weight of the transaction\n",
      "itself. In Figure 2, the only tips are A and C. Transaction A directly or indirectly\n",
      "approves transactions B,D, F,G, so the score of A is 1+3+1+3+1 = 9. Analogously,\n",
      "the score of C is 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to understand the arguments presented in this paper, one may safely\n",
      "assume that all transactions have an own weight equal to 1. From now on, we stick\n",
      "to this assumption. Under this assumption, the cumulative weight of transaction X\n",
      "becomes 1 plus the number of transactions that directly or indirectly approve X, and\n",
      "the score becomes 1 plus the number of transactions that are directly or indirectly\n",
      "approved by X.\n",

      "transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. In the high load regime the typical number of tips depends on the tip approval\n",
      "strategy employed by the new transaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If a transaction uses the strategy of approving two random tips, the typical\n",
      "number of tips is given by (1). It can be shown that this strategy is optimal\n",
      "with respect to the typical number of tips. However, it is not practical to adopt\n",
      "this strategy because it does not encourage approving tips.\n",

      "5. More elaborate strategies are needed to handle attacks and other network issues.\n",
      "A family of such strategies is discussed in Section 4.1.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The typical time for a tip to be approved is Θ(h) in the high load regime,\n",
      "where h is the average computation/propagation time for a node. However, if\n",
      "the first approval does not occur in the above time interval, it is a good idea\n",

      "2. Lack of conventions and interoperability:​ different verticals require different \n",

      "7.1 Token purpose and Use cases \n",

      " \n",
      "The ZXC token is also a part of the extended 0xcert ecosystem that spans beyond the \n",
      "protocol itself. We envision its usage on a few layers, which further decentralize \n",
      "important elements of the corresponding ecosystem.  \n",
      "\n",
      "7.1.1 ZXC within dapps \n",
      "Dapps developed by 0xcert (e.g. KYC and Academia pilot projects), may use the ZXC \n",
      "token as the basic liquid asset for these dapps to operate on the protocol. Similar to \n",
      "gas on the Ethereum blockchain, the protocol token may play a role in all sorts of \n",
      "protocol and dapp activities. The following use cases are foreseen, but not limited to, \n",
      "within a wide variety of dapps: \n",

      "Various stakeholders come together to co-create an ecosystem around the protocol \n",

      "authority or even the creators themselves.  \n",
      " \n",
      "Currently, the authenticity of issuers is ensured through centralized authorities. For \n",
      "example, higher education institutions have to go through a quality assurance process, \n",
      "which is carried out by an external body to verify if certain standards are met. This is \n",

      " \n",
      "The 0xcert ecosystem may introduce an Issuer Verification Registry (IVR), which would \n",

      " \n",
      "Due to the fact that the 0xcert protocol with its corresponding libraries is completely \n",
      "open source, there is a chance that these tools may be used by entities with ill intent. \n",
      "For example, if a well recognized education provider (e.g. Stanford) wants to issue \n",

      "this education provider maybe a well known and respected institution, there is no \n",

      "the blockchain space. A self-sustaining verification registry, which would use staking \n",
      "and rewarding mechanisms based on the 0xcert protocol token may answer many open \n",
      "questions in this relation. The Issuer Verification Registry (IVR) may use the ZXC token \n",
      "to give curation rights that correspond to the relative token weight of token holders. \n",
      "This is a floating ecosystem which has to be decoupled from price fluctuations of other \n",
      "cryptographic currencies or tokens. Only independent supply and demand of ZXC will \n",

      "much research in and of themselves, this work focuses\n",
      "on some of the technical challenges that all distributed\n",
      "payment systems must face. While these problems are\n",
      "varied, we group them into three main categories: cor-\n",
      "rectness, agreement, and utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "By correctness, we mean that it is necessary for a\n",
      "distributed system to be able to discern the difference be-\n",
      "tween a correct and fraudulent transaction. In traditional\n",
      "fiduciary settings, this is done through trust between\n",
      "institutions and cryptographic signatures that guarantee\n",
      "a transaction is indeed coming from the institution that\n",
      "it claims to be coming from. In distributed systems,\n",
      "however, there is no such trust, as the identity of any\n",
      "and all members in the network may not even be known.\n",

      "the difference lies in the fact that while a malicious\n",

      "fraudulent act. For example, a malicious user may make\n",
      "two simultaneous purchases, with only enough funds in\n",
      "their account to cover each purchase individually, but\n",
      "not both together. Thus each transaction by itself is\n",

      "utility properties, we first formalize those properties into\n",
      "axioms. These properties, when grouped together, form\n",

      "2.1 Ripple Protocol Components\n",
      "\n",
      "We begin our description of the ripple network by defin-\n",
      "ing the following terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Server: A server is any entity running the Ripple\n",
      "Server software (as opposed to the Ripple Client\n",
      "software which only lets a user send and receive\n",
      "funds), which participates in the consensus pro-\n",
      "cess.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Ledger: The ledger is a record of the amount\n",
      "of currency in each user’s account and represents\n",
      "the “ground truth” of the network. The ledger is\n",
      "repeatedly updated with transactions that success-\n",
      "fully pass through the consensus process.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Last-Closed Ledger: The last-closed ledger is\n",
      "the most recent ledger that has been ratified by the\n",
      "consensus process and thus represents the current\n",
      "state of the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Open Ledger: The open ledger is the current\n",
      "operating status of a node (each node maintains\n",
      "its own open ledger). Transactions initiated by\n",
      "end users of a given server are applied to the open\n",

      "ledger of that server, but transactions are not con-\n",

      "consensus process, at which point the open ledger\n",
      "becomes the last-closed ledger.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Unique Node List (UNL): Each server, s, main-\n",
      "tains a unique node list, which is a set of other\n",
      "servers that s queries when determining consen-\n",
      "sus. Only the votes of the other members of the\n",
      "UNL of s are considered when determining con-\n",
      "sensus (as opposed to every node on the network).\n",
      "Thus the UNL represents a subset of the network\n",
      "which when taken collectively, is “trusted” by s\n",
      "to not collude in an attempt to defraud the net-\n",
      "work. Note that this definition of “trust” does not\n",
      "require that each individual member of the UNL\n",
      "be trusted (see section 3.2).\n",
      "\n",
      "• Proposer: Any server can broadcast transactions\n",
      "to be included in the consensus process, and every\n",
      "server attempts to include every valid transaction\n",
      "when a new consensus round starts. During the\n",
      "consensus process, however, only proposals from\n",
      "servers on the UNL of a server s are considered\n",
      "by s.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 Formalization\n",
      "\n",
      "We use the term nonfaulty to refer to nodes in the net-\n",
      "work that behave honestly and without error. Conversely,\n",
      "a faulty node is one which experiences errors which may\n",
      "be honest (due to data corruption, implementation er-\n",
      "rors, etc.), or malicious (Byzantine errors). We reduce\n",
      "the notion of validating a transaction to a simple binary\n",
      "decision problem: each node must decide from the in-\n",
      "formation it has been given on the value 0 or 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "As in Attiya, Dolev, and Gill, 1984 [3], we define\n",
      "consensus according to the following three axioms:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. (C1): Every nonfaulty node makes a decision in\n",
      "finite time\n",
      "\n",
      "2. (C2): All nonfaulty nodes reach the same deci-\n",
      "sion value\n",
      "\n",
      "3. (C3): 0 and 1 are both possible values for all non-\n",
      "faulty nodes. (This removes the trivial solution\n",
      "in which all nodes decide 0 or 1 regardless of the\n",
      "information they have been presented).\n",
      "\n",
      "2.3 Existing Consensus Algorithms\n",
      "\n",
      "There has been much research done on algorithms that\n",
      "achieve consensus in the face of Byzantine errors. This\n",
      "\n",
      "previous work has included extensions to cases where all\n",
      "participants in the network are not known ahead of time,\n",
      "where the messages are sent asynchronously (there is\n",
      "no bound on the amount of time an individual node will\n",
      "take to reach a decision), and where there is a delineation\n",
      "between the notion of strong and weak consensus.\n",
      "\n",
      "One pertinent result of previous work on consen-\n",
      "sus algorithms is that of Fischer, Lynch, and Patterson,\n",
      "1985 [4], which proves that in the asynchronous case,\n",
      "non-termination is always a possibility for a consen-\n",
      "sus algorithm, even with just one faulty process. This\n",
      "introduces the necessity for time-based heuristics, to\n",
      "ensure convergence (or at least repeated iterations of\n",
      "non-convergence). We shall describe these heuristics for\n",
      "the Ripple Protocol in section 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strength of a consensus algorithm is usually\n",
      "measured in terms of the fraction of faulty processes\n",
      "it can tolerate. It is provable that no solution to the\n",
      "Byzantine Generals problem (which already assumes\n",
      "synchronicity, and known participants) can tolerate more\n",
      "than (n�1)/3 byzantine faults, or 33% of the network\n",
      "acting maliciously [2]. This solution does not, however,\n",
      "require verifiable authenticity of the messages delivered\n",
      "between nodes (digital signatures). If a guarantee on the\n",
      "unforgeability of messages is possible, algorithms ex-\n",
      "ist with much higher fault tolerance in the synchronous\n",
      "case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several algorithms with greater complexity have\n",
      "been proposed for Byzantine consensus in the asyn-\n",
      "chronous case. FaB Paxos [5] will tolerate (n� 1)/5\n",
      "Byzantine failures in a network of n nodes, amounting\n",
      "to a tolerance of up to 20% of nodes in the network\n",
      "colluding maliciously. Attiya, Doyev, and Gill [3] in-\n",
      "troduce a phase algorithm for the asynchronous case,\n",
      "which can tolerate (n� 1)/4 failures, or up to 25% of\n",
      "the network. Lastly, Alchieri et al., 2008 [6] present\n",
      "BFT-CUP, which achieves Byzantine consensus in the\n",
      "asynchronous case even with unknown participants, with\n",
      "the maximal bound of a tolerance of (n�1)/3 failures,\n",
      "but with additional restrictions on the connectivity of\n",
      "the underlying network.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.4 Formal Consensus Goals\n",
      "\n",
      "Our goal in this work is to show that the consensus\n",
      "algorithm utilized by the Ripple Protocol will achieve\n",
      "consensus at each ledger-close (even if consensus is the\n",
      "trivial consensus of all transactions being rejected), and\n",
      "that the trivial consensus will only be reached with a\n",
      "known probability, even in the face of Byzantine failures.\n",
      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Since each node in the network only votes on proposals\n",
      "from a trusted set of nodes (the other nodes in its UNL),\n",
      "and since each node may have differing UNLs, we also\n",
      "show that only one consensus will be reached amongst\n",
      "all nodes, regardless of UNL membership. This goal is\n",
      "also referred to as preventing a “fork” in the network: a\n",
      "situation in which two disjoint sets of nodes each reach\n",
      "consensus independently, and two different last-closed\n",
      "ledgers are observed by nodes on each node-set.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly we will show that the Ripple Protocol can\n",
      "achieve these goals in the face of (n� 1)/5 failures,\n",
      "which is not the strongest result in the literature, but we\n",
      "will also show that the Ripple Protocol possesses several\n",
      "other desirable features that greatly enhance its utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Ripple Consensus Algorithm\n",
      "\n",
      "The Ripple Protocol consensus algorithm (RPCA), is\n",
      "applied every few seconds by all nodes, in order to main-\n",
      "tain the correctness and agreement of the network. Once\n",
      "consensus is reached, the current ledger is considered\n",
      "“closed” and becomes the last-closed ledger. Assum-\n",
      "ing that the consensus algorithm is successful, and that\n",
      "there is no fork in the network, the last-closed ledger\n",
      "maintained by all nodes in the network will be identical.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.1 Definition\n",
      "\n",
      "The RPCA proceeds in rounds. In each round:\n",
      "\n",
      "• Initially, each server takes all valid transactions it\n",
      "has seen prior to the beginning of the consensus\n",
      "round that have not already been applied (these\n",
      "may include new transactions initiated by end-\n",
      "users of the server, transactions held over from\n",
      "a previous consensus process, etc.), and makes\n",
      "them public in the form of a list known as the\n",
      "“candidate set”.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Each server then amalgamates the candidate sets\n",
      "of all servers on its UNL, and votes on the veracity\n",
      "of all transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "• Transactions that receive more than a minimum\n",
      "percentage of “yes” votes are passed on to the next\n",
      "round, if there is one, while transactions that do\n",
      "not receive enough votes will either be discarded,\n",
      "or included in the candidate set for the beginning\n",
      "of the consensus process on the next ledger.\n",
      "\n",
      "• The final round of consensus requires a minimum\n",
      "percentage of 80% of a server’s UNL agreeing\n",
      "\n",
      "on a transaction. All transactions that meet this\n",
      "requirement are applied to the ledger, and that\n",
      "ledger is closed, becoming the new last-closed\n",
      "ledger.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.2 Correctness\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to achieve correctness, given a maximal amount\n",
      "of Byzantine failures, it must be shown that it is im-\n",
      "possible for a fraudulent transaction to be confirmed\n",
      "during consensus, unless the number of faulty nodes\n",
      "exceeds that tolerance. The proof of the correctness of\n",
      "the RPCA then follows directly: since a transaction is\n",
      "only approved if 80% of the UNL of a server agrees\n",
      "with it, as long as 80% of the UNL is honest, no fraud-\n",
      "ulent transactions will be approved. Thus for a UNL\n",
      "of n nodes in the network, the consensus protocol will\n",
      "maintain correctness so long as:\n",
      "\n",
      "f  (n�1)/5 (1)\n",
      "\n",
      "where f is the number Byzantine failures. In fact, even\n",
      "in the face of (n�1)/5+1 Byzantine failures, correct-\n",
      "ness is still technically maintained. The consensus pro-\n",
      "cess will fail, but it will still not be possible to confirm a\n",
      "fraudulent transaction. Indeed it would take (4n+1)/5\n",
      "Byzantine failures for an incorrect transaction to be con-\n",
      "firmed. We call this second bound the bound for weak\n",
      "correctness, and the former the bound for strong correct-\n",
      "ness.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should also be noted that not all “fraudulent” trans-\n",
      "actions pose a threat, even if confirmed during consen-\n",
      "sus. Should a user attempt to double-spend funds in\n",
      "two transactions, for example, even if both transactions\n",
      "are confirmed during the consensus process, after the\n",
      "first transaction is applied, the second will fail, as the\n",
      "funds are no longer available. This robustness is due to\n",
      "the fact that transactions are applied deterministically,\n",
      "and that consensus ensures that all nodes in the network\n",
      "are applying the deterministic rules to the same set of\n",
      "transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a slightly different analysis, let us assume that\n",
      "the probability that any node will decide to collude and\n",
      "join a nefarious cartel is pc. Then the probability of\n",

      "rather with the intent to minimize pc. Since nodes are\n",
      "not anonymous but rather cryptographically identifiable,\n",
      "selecting a UNL of nodes from a mixture of continents,\n",
      "nations, industries, ideologies, etc. will produce values\n",

      "tainly much, much smaller than 20%. Even if the UNL\n",
      "has a relatively large pc, say 15%, the probability of\n",
      "correctness is extremely high even with only 200 nodes\n",
      "in the UNL: 97.8%.\n",

      "\n",
      "3.3 Agreement\n",
      "\n",
      "To satisfy the agreement requirement, it must be shown\n",

      " \n",
      "TRON is an ambitious project dedicated to the establishment of a truly decentralized Internet and its \n",
      "infrastructure. The TRON Protocol, one of the largest blockchain-based operating systems in the \n",
      "world, offers public blockchain support of high throughput, high scalability, and high availability for \n",
      "all Decentralized Applications (DApps) in the TRON ecosystem. The July 2018 acquisition of \n",

      "\n",
      "1.2 Background \n",
      " \n",
      "The introduction of Bitcoin in 2009 revolutionized society’s perception of the traditional financial \n",
      "system in the wake of the Great Recession (2007-2008). As centralized hedge funds and banks \n",
      "collapsed from speculation in opaque financial derivatives, blockchain technology provided a \n",
      "transparent universal ledger from which anybody could glean transaction information. The \n",
      "transactions were cryptographically secured using a Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, \n",
      "thus preventing double spend issues. \n",
      " \n",
      "In late 2013, the Ethereum white paper proposed a network in which smart contracts and a \n",
      "Turing-complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) would allow developers to interact with the \n",
      "network through DApps. However, as transaction volumes in Bitcoin and Ethereum peaked in 2017, \n",
      "it was apparent from the low transaction throughput times and high transaction fees that \n",
      "cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum in their existing state were not scalable for widespread \n",
      "adoption. Thus, TRON was founded and envisioned as an innovative solution to these pressing \n",
      "scalability challenges.  \n",

      "launched its open source protocol. The Testnet, Blockchain Explorer, and Web Wallet were all \n",
      "launched by March 2018. TRON Mainnet launched shortly afterward in May 2018, marking the \n",
      "Odyssey 2.0 release as a technical milestone. In June 2018, TRON declared its independence with \n",
      "the creation of the Genesis block, along with the July 2018 acquisition of BitTorrent. In October \n",

      "Address/Wallet \n",
      "An address or wallet consisting of account credentials on the TRON network are generated by a \n",
      "key pair, which consists of a private key and a public key, the latter being derived from the former \n",
      "through an algorithm. The public key is usually used for session key encryption, signature \n",
      "verification, and encrypting data that could be decrypted by a corresponding private key. \n",
      " \n",
      "ABI \n",
      "An application binary interface (ABI) is an interface between two binary program modules; usually \n",
      "one of these modules is a library or an operating system facility, and the other is a user run \n",
      "program. \n",
      " \n",
      "API \n",
      "An application programming interface (API) is mainly used for user clients development. With API \n",
      "support, token issuance platforms can also be designed by developers themselves. \n",
      " \n",
      "Asset \n",
      "In TRON's documents, asset is the same as token, which is also denoted as TRC-10 token. \n",
      " \n",
      "Bandwidth Points (BP) \n",
      "To keep the network operating smoothly, TRON network transactions use BP as fuel. Each account \n",
      "gets 5000 free daily BP and more can be obtained by freezing TRX for BP. Both TRX and TRC-10 \n",
      "token transfers are normal transactions costing BP.  Smart contract deployment and execution \n",
      "transactions consume both BP and Energy. \n",
      " \n",
      "Block \n",
      "Blocks contain the digital records of transactions. A complete block consists of the magic number, \n",
      "block size, block header, transaction counter, and transaction data. \n",
      " \n",
      "Block Reward \n",
      "Block production rewards are sent to a sub-account (address/wallet). Super Representatives can \n",

      " \n",
      "Block Header \n",
      "A block header is part of a block. TRON block headers contain the previous block’s hash, the \n",

      "1 Introduction\n",
      "In the first part of this paper, we will discuss the concept of abstract blockchains\n",
      "and the implementation of a self-amending crypto-ledger. In the second part,\n",
      "we will describe our proposed seed protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "2 Self-amending cryptoledger\n",
      "A blockchain protocol can be decomposed into three distinct protocols:\n",
      "\n",
      "- The network protocol discovers blocks and broadcasts transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The transaction protocol specifies what makes a transaction valid.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The consensus protocol forms consensus around a unique chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tezos implements a generic network shell. This shell is agnostic to the\n",
      "transaction protocol and to the consensus protocol. We refer to the transaction\n",
      "protocol and the consensus protocol together as a “blockchain protocol”. We\n",
      "will first give a mathematical representation of a blockchain protocol and then\n",
      "describe some of the implementation choices in Tezos.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.1 Mathematical representation\n",
      "A blockchain protocol is fundamentally a monadic implementation of concurrent\n",
      "mutations of a global state. This is achieved by defining “blocks” as operators\n",
      "acting on this global state. The free monoid of blocks acting on the genesis state\n",
      "forms a tree structure. A global, canonical, state is defined as the minimal leaf\n",
      "for a specified ordering.\n",
      "\n",
      "This suggests the following abstract representation:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Let (S,≤) be a totally ordered, countable, set of possible states.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Let ⊘ /∈ S represent a special, invalid, state.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Let B ⊂ SS∪{⊘} be the set of blocks. The set of valid blocks is B ∩ SS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The total order on S is extended so that ∀s ∈ S,⊘ < s. This order deter-\n",
      "mines which leaf in the block tree is considered to be the canonical one. Blocks\n",
      "in B are seen as operators acting on the state.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, any blockchain protocol1 (be it Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Ethereum,\n",
      "Cryptonote, etc) can be fully determined by the tuple:(\n",
      "\n",
      "S,≤,⊘,B ⊂ SS∪{⊘}\n",
      ")\n",
      "\n",
      "1GHOST is an approach which orders the leafs based on properties of the tree. Such an\n",
      "approach is problematic for both theoretical and practical reasons. It is almost always better\n",
      "to emulate it by inserting proofs of mining in the main chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The networking protocol is fundamentally identical for these blockchains.\n",
      "“Mining” algorithms are but an emergent property of the network, given the\n",
      "incentives for block creation.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Tezos, we make a blockchain protocol introspective by letting blocks act\n",
      "on the protocol itself. We can then express the set of protocols recursively as\n",
      "\n",
      "P =\n",
      "{(\n",
      "\n",

      ")}\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2 The network shell\n",
      "This formal mathematical description doesn’t tell us how to build the block tree.\n",
      "This is the role of the network shell, which acts as an interface between a gossip\n",
      "network and the protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "The network shell works by maintaining the best chain known to the client.\n",
      "It is aware of three type of objects. The first two are transactions and blocks,\n",
      "which are only propagated through the network if deemed valid. The third are\n",
      "protocols, OCaml modules used to amend the existing protocol. They will be\n",
      "described in more details later on. For now we will focus on transaction and\n",
      "blocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most arduous part of the network shell is to protect nodes against\n",
      "denial-of-service attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.1 Clock\n",
      "\n",
      "Every block carries a timestamp visible to the network shell. Blocks that appear\n",
      "to come from the future are buffered if their timestamps are within a few minutes\n",
      "of the system time and rejected otherwise. The protocol design must tolerate\n",
      "reasonable clock drifts in the clients and must assume that timestamps can be\n",
      "falsified.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.2.2 Chain selection algorithm\n",
      "\n",
      "The shell maintains a single chain rather than a full tree of blocks. This chain\n",
      "is only overwritten if the client becomes aware of a strictly better chain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maintaining a tree would be more parsimonious in terms of network commu-\n",
      "nications but would be susceptible to denial-of-service attacks where an attacker\n",
      "produces a large number of low-scoring but valid forks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, it remains possible for a node to lie about the score of a given chain, a\n",
      "lie that the client may only uncover after having processed a potentially large\n",
      "number of blocks. However, such a node can be subsequently ignored.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fortunately, a protocol can have the property that low scoring chains exhibit\n",
      "a low rate of block creation. Thus, the client would only consider a few blocks\n",
      "of a “weak” fork before concluding that the announced score was a lie.\n",

      "2.2.3 Network level defense\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, the shell is “defensive”. It attempts to connect to many peers across\n",
      "various IP ranges. It detects disconnected peers and bans malicious nodes.\n",
      "\n",
      "To protect against certain denial of service attacks, the protocol provides\n",
      "the shell with context dependent bounds on the size of blocks and transactions.\n",

      "2.3 Functional representation\n",
      "2.3.1 Validating the chain\n",
      "\n",
      "We can efficiently capture almost all the genericity of our abstract blockchain\n",
      "structure with the following OCaml types. To begin with, a block header is\n",
      "defined as:\n",
      "type raw_block_header = {\n",

      "\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "We are purposefully not typing the header field more strongly so it can\n",
      "represent arbitrary content. However, we do type the fields necessary for the\n",
      "operation of the shell. These include the hash of the preceding block, a list of\n",
      "operation hashes and a timestamp. In practice, the operations included in a\n",
      "block are transmitted along with the blocks at the network level. Operations\n",
      "themselves are represented as arbitrary blobs.\n",
      "type raw_operation = Bytes.t\n",
      "\n",
      "The state is represented with the help of a Context module which encap-\n",
      "sulates a disk-based immutable key-value store. The structure of a key-value\n",

      "generic structure, similar to the one used in software versioning, which is quite\n",
      "versatile in representing various orderings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why not define a comparison function within the protocol modules? First\n",
      "off it would be hard to enforce the requirement that such a function represent a\n",
      "total order. The score projection always verifies this (ties can be broken based on\n",
      "the hash of the last block). Second, in principle we need the ability to compare\n",
      "states across distinct protocols. Specific protocol amendment rules are likely to\n",
      "make this extremely unlikely to ever happen, but the network shell does not\n",
      "know that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The operations parse_block_header and parse_operation are exposed\n",

      "\n",
      "Bitcoin is the first digital currency to achieve widespread adoption. The currency owes its rise\n",
      "in part to the fact that, unlike traditional e-cash schemes [Cha82, CHL05, ST99], it requires no\n",
      "trusted parties. Instead of appointing a central bank, Bitcoin uses a distributed ledger known as the\n",
      "block chain to store transactions carried out between users. Because the block chain is massively\n",
      "replicated by mutually-distrustful peers, the information it contains is public.\n",
      "\n",
      "While users may employ many identities (or pseudonyms) to enhance their privacy, an increasing\n",
      "body of research shows that anyone can de-anonymize Bitcoin by using information in the block\n",
      "chain [RM11, BBSU12, RS12, MPJ+13], such as the structure of the transaction graph as well as\n",
      "the value and dates of transactions. As a result, Bitcoin fails to offer even a modicum of the privacy\n",
      "provided by traditional payment systems, let alone the robust privacy of anonymous e-cash schemes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Bitcoin is not anonymous itself, those with sufficient motivation can obfuscate their\n",
      "transaction history with the help of mixes (also known as laundries or tumblers). A mix allows\n",
      "users to entrust a set of coins to a pool operated by a central party and then, after some interval,\n",
      "retrieve different coins (with the same total value) from the pool. However, mixes suffer from\n",
      "three limitations: (i) the delay to reclaim coins must be large to allow enough coins to be mixed\n",
      "in; (ii) the mix operator can trace coins; and (iii) the mix operator may steal coins.1 For users\n",
      "with “something to hide”, these risks may be acceptable. But typical legitimate users (1) wish to\n",
      "keep their spending habits private from their peers, (2) are risk-averse and do not wish to expend\n",
      "continual effort in protecting their privacy, and (3) are often not sufficiently aware that their privacy\n",
      "has been compromised.\n",
      "\n",
      "To protect their privacy, users thus need an instant, risk-free, and, most importantly, automatic\n",
      "guarantee that data revealing their spending habits and account balances is not publicly accessible\n",
      "by their neighbors, co-workers, and the merchants with whom they do business. Anonymous\n",
      "transactions also ensure that the market value of a coin is independent of its history, thus ensuring\n",
      "that legitimate users’ coins remain fungible.2\n",
      "\n",
      "Zerocoin: a decentralized mix. Miers et al. [MGGR13] proposed Zerocoin, which extends\n",
      "Bitcoin to provide strong anonymity guarantees. Like many e-cash protocols (e.g., [CHL05]),\n",
      "Zerocoin employs zero-knowledge proofs to prevent transaction graph analyses. Unlike earlier\n",
      "practical e-cash protocols, however, Zerocoin does not rely on digital signatures to validate coins,\n",
      "nor does it require a central bank to prevent double spending. Instead, Zerocoin authenticates\n",
      "coins by proving, in zero-knowledge, that they belong to a public list of valid coins (which can be\n",
      "maintained on the block chain). Yet rather than a full-fledged anonymous currency, Zerocoin is\n",
      "a decentralized mix, where users may periodically “wash” their bitcoins via the Zerocoin protocol.\n",
      "Routine day-to-day transactions must be conducted via Bitcoin, due to reasons that we now review.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first reason is performance. Redeeming zerocoins requires double-discrete-logarithm proofs\n",
      "of knowledge, which have size that exceeds 45 kB and require 450 ms to verify (at the 128-bit\n",
      "security level).3 These proofs must be broadcast through the network, verified by every node, and\n",
      "permanently stored in the ledger. The entailed costs are higher, by orders of magnitude, than those\n",
      "in Bitcoin and can seriously tax a Bitcoin network operating at normal scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "1CoinJoin [Max13], an alternative proposal, replaces the central party of a mix with multi-signature transactions\n",
      "that involve many collaborating Bitcoin users. CoinJoin can thus only mix small volumes of coins amongst users who\n",
      "are currently online, is prone to denial-of-service attacks by third parties, and requires effort to find mixing partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "2While the methods we detail in this paper accomplish this, the same techniques open the door for privacy-preserving\n",
      "accountability and oversight (see Section 10).\n",
      "\n",
      "3These published numbers [MGGR13] actually use a mix of parameters at both 128-bit and 80-bit security for\n",

      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The second reason is functionality. While Zerocoin constitutes a basic e-cash scheme, it lacks\n",
      "critical features required of full-fledged anonymous payments. First, Zerocoin uses coins of fixed\n",
      "denomination: it does not support payments of exact values, nor does it provide a means to give\n",
      "change following a transaction (i.e., divide coins). Second, Zerocoin has no mechanism for one\n",
      "user to pay another one directly in “zerocoins”. And third, while Zerocoin provides anonymity\n",
      "by unlinking a payment transaction from its origin address, it does not hide the amount or other\n",
      "metadata about transactions occurring on the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our contribution. Addressing this challenge, this work offers two main contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "(1) We introduce the notion of a decentralized anonymous payment scheme, which formally captures\n",
      "the functionality and security guarantees of a full-fledged decentralized electronic currency with\n",
      "strong anonymity guarantees. We provide a construction of this primitive and prove its security\n",
      "under specific cryptographic assumptions. The construction leverages recent advances in the area of\n",
      "zero-knowledge proofs. Specifically, it uses zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARguments of\n",
      "Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) [Gro10, Lip12, BCI+13, GGPR13, PGHR13, BCG+13, Lip13, BCTV14].\n",
      "\n",
      "(2) We implement the above primitive, via a system that we call Zerocash. Our system (at 128\n",
      "bits of security):\n",
      "• reduces the size of transactions spending a coin to under 1 kB (an improvement of over 97.7%);\n",
      "• reduces the spend-transaction verification time to under 6 ms (an improvement of over 98.6%);\n",
      "• allows for anonymous transactions of variable amounts;\n",
      "• hides transaction amounts and the values of coins held by users; and\n",
      "• allows for payments to be made directly to a user’s fixed address (without user interaction).\n",
      "\n",
      "To validate our system, we measured its performance and established feasibility by conducting\n",
      "experiments in a test network of 1000 nodes (approximately 116 of the unique IPs in the Bitcoin\n",
      "network and 13 of the nodes reachable at any given time [DW13]). This inspires confidence that\n",
      "Zerocash can be deployed as a fork of Bitcoin and operate at the same scale. Thus, due to its\n",
      "substantially improved functionality and performance, Zerocash makes it possible to entirely replace\n",
      "traditional Bitcoin payments with anonymous alternatives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Concurrent work. The idea of using zk-SNARKs in the Bitcoin setting was first presented by one\n",
      "of the authors at Bitcoin 2013 [Ben13]. In concurrent work, Danezis et al. [DFKP13] suggest using\n",

      "\n",
      "Zerocash can be deployed atop any ledger (even one maintained by a central bank). Here, we briefly\n",
      "detail integration with the Bitcoin protocol. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, in the following\n",
      "section when referring to Bitcoin, and its unit of account bitcoin (plural bitcoins), we mean the\n",
      "underlying protocol and software, not the currency system. (The discussion holds, with little or no\n",
      "modification, for many forks of Bitcoin, also known as “altcoins”, such as Litecoin.)\n",
      "\n",
      "By introducing new transaction types and payment semantics, Zerocash breaks compatibility\n",
      "with the Bitcoin network. While Zerocash could be integrated into Bitcoin (the actual currency and\n",
      "its supporting software) via a “flag day” where a super-majority of Bitcoin miners simultaneously\n",
      "adopt the new software, we neither expect nor advise such integration in the near future and suggest\n",
      "using Zerocash in a separate altcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrating Zerocash into Bitcoin consists of adding a new transaction type, Zerocash transactions,\n",
      "and modifying the protocol and software to invoke Zerocash’s DAP interface to create and verify\n",
      "these transactions. There are at least two possible approaches to this integration. The first approach\n",
      "replaces all bitcoins with zerocoins, making all transactions anonymous at the cost of losing any\n",
      "additional Bitcoin functionality provided by, e.g., the Bitcoin scripting language (see Section 6.1).\n",
      "The second approach maintains this functionality, adding a parallel Zerocash currency, zerocoin,\n",
      "which can be converted to and from bitcoin at a one-to-one rate (see Section 6.2). Options for\n",
      "protocol-level modifications for the later approach are discussed in Section 6.3; the former can be\n",
      "readily inferred. In Section 6.4 we discuss anonymizing the network layer of Bitcoin and anonymity\n",
      "safeguards.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1 Integration by replacing the base currency\n",
      "\n",
      "One approach is to alter the underlying system so that all monetary transactions are done using\n",
      "Zerocash, i.e., by invoking the DAP interface and writing/reading the associated transactions in the\n",
      "distributed ledger.\n",
      "\n",
      "As seen in Section 3, this suffices to offer the core functionality of payments, minting, merging,\n",
      "splitting, etc., while assuring users that all transactions using this currency are anonymous. However,\n",
      "this has several drawbacks: (1) All pour transactions incur the cost of generating a zk-SNARK proof.\n",
      "(2) If Bitcoin supports additional features, such as a scripting language for specifying conditions for\n",
      "claiming bitcoins (as in Bitcoin), then these features are lost.17 (3) Bitcoin allows the flexibility of\n",
      "spending unconfirmed transactions; instead, with a Zerocash-only Bitcoin, this flexibility is lost:\n",
      "transactions must be confirmed before they can be spent. (And this imposes a minimal delay\n",
      "between receiving funds and spending them.)\n",
      "\n",
      "6.2 Integration by hybrid currency\n",
      "\n",
      "A different approach is to extend Bitcoin with a parallel, anonymized currency of “zerocoins”,\n",
      "existing alongside bitcoins, using the same ledger, and with the ability to convert freely between\n",
      "the two. The behavior and functionality of regular bitcoins is unaltered; in particular, they may\n",
      "support functionality such as scripting.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this approach, the Bitcoin ledger consists of Bitcoin-style transactions, containing inputs and\n",
      "outputs [Nak09]. Each input is either a pointer to an output of a previous transaction (as in plain\n",

      "The usual invariant over bitcoins is maintained and checked in plain view: the sum of bitcoin inputs\n",

      "difference is offered as a transaction fee. However, the accounting for zerocoins consumed and\n",
      "produced is done separately and implicitly by the DAP scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "The life cycle of a zerocoin is as follows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creating new zerocoins. A mint transaction consumes v worth of bitcoins as inputs, and outputs\n",
      "coin commitment worth v zerocoins. The v bitcoins are effectively destroyed, in exchange for the\n",
      "newly-minted zerocoins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spending zerocoins. Zerocoins can then be transferred, split, and merged into other zerocoins\n",

      "\n",
      "Spending multiple zerocoins. To allow for pours to span more than two input and output coins,\n",
      "txPour structures may be chained together within one transaction by marking some output coin\n",
      "commitments as intermediates and having subsequent pours in the same transaction constructed\n",
      "relative to an ephemeral Merkle tree consisting of only the intermediates commitments. For example,\n",
      "a transaction might accept four input coins, with the first two Pour operations combining two\n",
      "of the inputs to produce an intermediate commitment each and a final Pour combining the two\n",
      "intermediate commitments into a final output new coin. Since the intermediate results are consumed\n",
      "instantly within the transaction, they need not be recorded in the global Merkle tree or have their\n",
      "serial numbers marked as spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transaction fees. Collecting transaction fees is done as usual, via a coinbase transaction added\n",
      "to each block, which pays as mining reward the difference between the total inputs (bitcoin and\n",
      "pours’ vpub) and total outputs (bitcoin and mints’ v) in this block. Payment is either in bitcoins or\n",
      "in newly-minted zerocoins (via a Mint).\n",

      "Validation and block generation. All transactions are verified via VerifyTransaction when they\n",

      "6.3 Extending the Bitcoin protocol to support the combined semantics\n",
      "\n",
      "While the section above describes the life-cycle of a zerocoin and semantics of the system, there\n",
      "remains the question of how transactions acquire the above necessary semantics. Two implementation\n",
      "approaches are possible, with different engineering tradeoffs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first approach is to extend the protocol and its implementation with hard-coded validation\n",

      "VerifyTransaction. In this case the zk-SNARK itself effectively replaces the scripting language for\n",
      "Zerocash transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second approach is to extend Bitcoin’s scripting language by adding an opcode that\n",
      "invokes VerifyTransaction, with the requisite arguments embeded alongside the opcode script. Such\n",
      "transactions must be exempt from the requirement they reference an input (as they are Zerocash\n",
      "transactions are self-contained), and, like coinbase transactions, be able to create bitcoins ex nihilo\n",
      "(to account for vpub). Moreover, while VerifyTransaction is run at the standard point in the Bitcoin\n",
      "transaction processing flow for evaluating scripts, the coin commitments and spent serial numbers\n",

      "\n",
      "6.4 Additional anonymity considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "Zerocash only anonymizes the transaction ledger. Network traffic used to announce transactions,\n",
      "retrieve blocks, and contact merchants still leaks identifying information (e.g., IP addresses). Thus\n",
      "users need some anonymity network to safely use Zerocash. The most obvious way to do this is\n",
      "via Tor [DMS04]. Given that Zerocash transactions are not low latency themselves, Mixnets (e.g.,\n",
      "Mixminion [DDM03]) are also a viable way to add anonymity (and one that, unlike Tor, is not as\n",
      "vulnerable to traffic analysis). Using mixnets that provide email-like functionality has the added\n",
      "benefit of providing an out-of-band notification mechanism that can replace Receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, although in theory all users have a single view of the block chain, a powerful\n",
      "attacker could potentially fabricate an additional block solely for a targeted user. Spending any\n",
      "coins with respect to the updated Merkle tree in this “poison-pill” block will uniquely identify the\n",
      "targeted user. To mitigate such attacks, users should check with trusted peers their view of the\n",
      "block chain and, for sensitive transactions, only spend coins relative to blocks further back in the\n",
      "ledger (since creating the illusion for multiple blocks is far harder).\n",
      "\n",
      "7 Experiments\n",
      "\n",
      "To measure the performance of Zerocash, we ran several experiments. First, we benchmarked the\n",

      "needs to be updated when a serial number is added; the other sublists and authentication paths\n",

      "10 Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Decentralized currencies should ensure a user’s privacy from his peers when conducting legitimate\n",
      "financial transactions. Zerocash provides such privacy protection, by hiding user identities, trans-\n",
      "action amounts, and account balances from public view. This, however, may be criticized for\n",
      "hampering accountability, regulation, and oversight. Yet Zerocash need not be limited to enforcing\n",
      "the basic monetary invariants of a currency system. The underlying zk-SNARK cryptographic proof\n",
      "machinery is flexible enough to support a wide range of policies. It can, for example, let a user prove\n",
      "that he paid his due taxes on all transactions without revealing those transactions, their amounts, or\n",
      "even the amount of taxes paid. As long as the policy can be specified by efficient nondeterministic\n",
      "computation using NP statements, it can (in principle) be enforced using zk-SNARKs, and added\n",
      "to Zerocash. This can enable automated, privacy-preserving verification and enforcement of a wide\n",
      "range of compliance and regulatory policies that would otherwise be invasive to check directly or\n",
      "might be bypassed by corrupt authorities. This raises research, policy, and engineering questions\n",
      "regarding which such policies are desirable and practically realizable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another research question is what new functionality can be realized by augmenting the capabilities\n",
      "already present in Bitcoin’s scripting language with zk-SNARKs that allow fast verification of\n",
