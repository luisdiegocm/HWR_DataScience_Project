Into the Ether with Ethereum Classic 
The Store-of-Value Commodity to Power the Internet of Things 
 
 
Matthew Beck, CFA   |   March 2017 
 
 
 
In this next wave of the digital revolution, digital currencies have emerged as what many believe to 
be the greatest innovation since the advent of the internet. For the first time in history, value can be 
sent anywhere in the world at the same speed as information in a secure and trustless way. However, 
digital currencies are more than just payment facilitators. They offer an alternative to the economic, 
political, and social systems run by a handful of large institutions. Powered by millions of peers within 
globally distributed networks, digital currencies are democratizing information and value in 
incredible new ways.  We believe in a future of multiple digital assets, each with unique comparative 
advantages that enable them to play distinct roles in driving economic growth and in diversifying 
investment portfolios. 
 
In light of this view, our team has been increasingly focused on the investment potential of Ethereum 
Classic and its associated digital token, ETC. Ethereum Classic is a next generation blockchain 
platform for a new internet infrastructure – one that can dramatically enhance the ways that 
information and value are shared in the digital economy, unlocking trillions of dollars in untapped 
economic surplus in the process.1 Featuring a flexible and intuitive smart contract programming 
platform that is powered by ETC, we believe Ethereum Classic may one day be the substrate for a 
global, secure, and decentralized Internet of Things (IoT).  
 
As individuals and commercial enterprises begin to appreciate the ways that Ethereum Classic can 
radically improve the quality of our lives, ETC may become more valuable as a scarce commodity 
that powers this new digital economy. In this paper, we explore: 
 
 

 The origins of Ethereum & Ethereum Classic 
 The relative investability of ether classic (ETC) vs. ether (ETH)  
 The investment opportunity that ETC presents as a store-of-value commodity that can power 

the IoT 
 How a strategic allocation to ETC can improve the efficiency of investor portfolios  

 
 
Throughout this paper, we will evaluate the investment opportunity presented by ETC using a similar 
framework to the one used for bitcoin in our previous study, Bitcoin & the Rise of Digital Gold.

The Origins of Ethereum & Ethereum Classic 
 
 
In late 2013, programmer and co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine, Vitalik Buterin, published a white paper 
detailing an innovative digital currency-powered technology platform known as Ethereum.2 As an 
early adopter of bitcoin, Vitalik developed the view that a digital token and its associated blockchain 
could facilitate much more than just peer-to-peer electronic value transfer. In pursuit of this grander 
vision, he set out to create a computationally complete virtual ecosystem, featuring a global 
blockchain and “smart contract” programming platform. Both would be powered by a native digital 
asset, known as ether (ETH). 
 
By integrating programming capabilities directly into the Ethereum protocol, developers all over the 
world would be able to design a new class of decentralized applications hosted on a public 
blockchain. Through the use of smart contracts, applications built on Ethereum could automate the 
transmission of information and value between one another under dynamic conditions, enabling 
tailored business models for the Internet of Things and Machine-Payable Web.3 In many ways, 
Ethereum was designed to be the next iteration of operating systems like Apple iOS or Microsoft 
Windows, embedded with the enhanced capabilities of blockchain technology. 
 
Ethereum was built on the same fundamental principles as Bitcoin; namely, that a blockchain protocol 
should be decentralized and its transaction ledger, immutable. To this day, many in the 
cryptocurrency community strongly believe that these principles are critical for the organic growth 
and economical sustainability of distributed blockchain systems.  
 
On July 30th, 2015, less than two years after the original white paper was published, Vitalik and a non-
profit foundation launched Ethereum. 
 
The DAO and the Death of Principles 
 
With the promise of a more secure and scalable internet infrastructure came excitement around the 
novel applications and business models planned to be built on Ethereum. The one garnering the most 
attention was the now defunct decentralized autonomous organization, known as “The DAO.”  
 
In April 2016, a blockchain and IoT solutions company known as Slock.it announced the launch of 
The DAO on Ethereum. The DAO was designed as a decentralized crowdfunding model, in which 
anyone could contribute ETH tokens to become a voting member and equity stakeholder in the 
organization. Members of The DAO could then make proposals about different projects to pursue 
and put them to a vote. By committing to profitable projects, members would be rewarded based on 
the terms of a smart contract and their proportional interest in The DAO.4 As of May 27th, 2016, $150 
million, or approximately 14% of all ETH outstanding, was contributed to and invested in The DAO.5

on computer code.

On June 17th, 2016, an anonymous hacker used an exploit in The DAO smart contract code to syphon 
approximately $60 million worth of tokens into a segregated account.6 Upon the news of the breach, 
the price of ETH was quickly cut in half, as investors liquidated their holdings and members of the 
Ethereum community scrambled to determine a solution. 
 
In the days that followed, several attempts were made to retrieve the stolen funds and secure the 
Ethereum network. However, it soon became apparent that direct interference with the protocol (i.e. 
a hard fork) might be necessary, sparking a heated debate within the Ethereum community. The 
argument for the hard fork was that it would create an entirely new version of the Ethereum 
blockchain, erasing any record of the theft, and restoring the stolen funds to their original owners. 
The counterargument was that it would be antithetical to the core principle of immutability, thus 
compromising a key driver of value for the entire system. 
 
As the debate raged on, the decision over whether or not to fork the network was put to a vote and 
on July 15th, 2016, a hard fork specification was implemented by the Ethereum Foundation. It is worth 
noting that holders of less than 6% of the ETH in circulation voted on the matter over a narrow 12-day 
period, raising questions about whether the decision was truly democratic.7 On July 20th, 2016, the 
Ethereum network completed the hard fork, and a new version of the blockchain, without recognition 
of the theft, was born.  
 
Many believed that the original version of the Ethereum blockchain would dissipate entirely following 
the hard fork. However, it quickly became clear that there were participants who were committed to 
supporting its continuation for philosophical and economic reasons. On July 20th, 2016, the original 
Ethereum protocol was rebranded as Ethereum Classic, and its native token as ETC, preserving the 
untampered transaction history (including The DAO theft) and the foundational principles of 
decentralization and immutability.

A Tale of Two Ethereums 
 
 
Today, there remain two versions of Ethereum, each with nearly identical potential real-world 
applications, but critical differences in their governance, economic, and development structures. We 
believe that Ethereum Classic and ETC offer a more attractive long-term investment opportunity 
versus Ethereum and ETH as a self-sustainable system with advantages along three dimensions.  
 
Protocol Governance 
 
There is a growing base of quantitative and qualitative research evidencing a positive relationship 
between good governance and the long-term performance of traditional assets.8 We believe this 
concept extends to digital currencies and is perhaps even more important in determining their 
investability.  
 
In the world of digital currencies, the quality of a governance system can be assessed on its principles 
and design. Principles are important because they establish the collective values of participants and 
design is important because it is ensures a structure that supports and protects those values.  
 
By violating the principles of decentralization and immutability, the Ethereum Foundation has 
undermined the trustless nature of the Ethereum network, opening the door to entirely new risks 
associated with threats of interference. At the extreme end of the spectrum, there is a high degree of 
fat tail risk as any future intervention could cause participants to abandon ETH entirely. On the 
contrary, Ethereum Classic maintains principles that substantially mitigate these risks to preserve a 
trustless, open network.  
 
From a design perspective, the distributed consensus mechanisms employed to validate transactions 
on each version of Ethereum will differ substantially going forward. The Ethereum Classic community 
is leaning towards sticking to a proven proof-of-work security model until it is decisively 
demonstrated that a better model is effective. With a proof-of-work model, transactions are 
confirmed using cryptographic algorithms that ensure tokens have not been double-spent. This is 
the same security model that underlies Bitcoin, the most successful global blockchain protocol.  
 
On the contrary, the Ethereum Foundation intends to migrate Ethereum from proof-of-work to proof-
of-stake in the foreseeable future. With a proof-of-stake model, select token holders are chosen and 
relied upon to verify transactions accurately. It is presupposed that they will do so because they have 
a “stake” in the system and would suffer the consequences of falsifying transactions. While this 
approach makes sense in theory, the devil is in the details. We are skeptical about the ability of the 
Ethereum Foundation’s proof-of-stake model, dubbed Casper, to replicate the security and scalability 
of tested proof-of-work models. We are content to wait until Casper demonstrates that it is self-
sustainable before committing capital to ETH. Furthermore, we are concerned by the opacity of the 
transition roadmap, including the procedures for testing and vetting. Investors would be prudent to 
invest in digital asset models with a strong track-record, where the risks are better understood.

Protocol Economics 
 
Recognizing the need for a robust economic framework that balances the long-term interests of 
investors, developers, and business operators alike, key stakeholders in the Ethereum Classic 
community announced their commitment to implement a new monetary model on March 1st, 2017.9  
 
Similar to Bitcoin, the new policy was built on the fundamental economic principle that the value of 
an asset is a function of its utility and its scarcity. As such, it establishes a hard cap on the total ETC 
issuance. The current miner reward of 5 ETC per block will be reduced by 20% at block number 5 
million, and another 20% every 5 million blocks thereafter. A block of transactions is confirmed on 
Ethereum Classic about every 15 seconds. Due to slight variations in the block reward rate, it is 
anticipated that the total supply of ETC will reach ~210 million and will never exceed 230 million.10 It 
should be noted that as of March 2nd, 2017, approximately 3.3 million blocks have been mined, setting 
the total ETC outstanding at 89.3 million, and the overall market capitalization at $120.9 million.  
 
The roadmap for implementing the new and improved Ethereum Classic monetary model is set as 
follows:

We believe that the successful execution of these key milestones solidifies a sound economic 
framework that supports long-term investment in ETC.

On the contrary, Ethereum does not incorporate a cap on the overall supply of ETH. To highlight this 
difference, below we compare the estimated supply and inflation rates for ETC and ETH based on 
their existing emission models. While there is no guarantee that the ETH supply model will remain the 
same in the future, estimates purport that in 30 years there could be twice as many ETH as ETC 
outstanding.12 As a result, ETH would need to generate a substantially higher rate of return to justify 
a valuation at parity with ETC.

Although the aforementioned suggests that ETC may be significantly undervalued relative to ETH, 
there are some risks that are worth noting: 
 
First, we’d highlight two large holders of ETC; one which has sold the lion’s share of their tokens, and 
another which still owns a significant amount. The Ethereum Foundation has liquidated 90% of their 
ETC holdings, tokens which they automatically received when the protocol forked.15 While they have 
completed a majority of their ETC sales, the remaining 10% could still impact the overall market.  
Furthermore, the DAO hacker still holds approximately 3.36 million ETC (roughly 4% of all ETC in 
circulation) in a wallet address that is identifiable on the blockchain.16 It is important for investors to 
remember that large blocks of ETC could be sold at any time, potentially placing downward pressure 
on the ETC price.  
 
Second, despite the fact that the previous charts show the current supply and inflation rates for ETC 
and ETH, questions remain as to how the ETH supply model will be impacted by the implementation 
of Casper. In various posts on Reddit, Vitalik has stated that the incentives designed to lure 
stakeholders towards Casper will result in a systematic slowing of ETH issuance, beginning as early 
as the second half of 2017.17 However, given that a concentrated group of developers and 
contributors (including the Ethereum Foundation) purchased 72 million of the 89.4 million ETH 
outstanding during the 2014 pre-sale, any slowing of ETH’s supply rate could raise significant 
concerns about centralization.18 This is even more alarming in the context of a proof-of-stake version 
of the protocol, where large stakeholders can have tremendous influence, potentially at the expense 
of other network participants. 
 
Protocol Development 
 
There is no doubt that talented minds are working on both projects: Vitalik Buterin and the Ethereum 
Foundation are driving forward the roadmap for Ethereum, while IOHK, the ETCDEV Team, and other 
independent community members are leading the way for Ethereum Classic. You can learn more 
about the individuals supporting Ethereum Classic development at: 
 
https://iohk.io/team/ 
https://www.etcdevteam.com/ 
 
Yet a major difference between the two projects can be seen in the structure supporting protocol 
development. Although Ethereum claims to be a decentralized platform, it is centrally funded by the 
Ethereum Foundation. The development funding (and consequently the innovation roadmap) is 
largely directed by a single entity and a few individuals. Within the Ethereum Classic community 
exists a counter-ideology; that a completely decentralized environment allows for abundant 
possibilities that would otherwise be hindered under the direction of a single organization. Many 
believe that the Ethereum Foundation’s strategy will lead Ethereum to suffer the same consequences 
as early instances of the internet, where walled gardens created by the likes of AOL, CompuServe 
and MSN were ultimately superseded by the open internet structure that exists today. Whether or not 
this is an accurate analogy remains to be seen.

Our team’s conviction in ETC is further bolstered by superior transparency in the development 
roadmap for Ethereum Classic. Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK and co-founder and former CEO of 
the Ethereum Project, continues to actively contribute to the roadmap’s transparency through a 
variety of communication mediums including Slack, Reddit, Twitter, and the “Let’s Talk ETC” 
podcast.19 The Grothendieck Team, hired by IOHK, conducts weekly standups to discuss their 
progress towards building a new and improved client to support Ethereum Classic.20 The ETCDEV 
Team is working on new implementations of the monetary model, a flexible software developer kit 
that can be used to build applications on the Ethereum Classic blockchain, and performance and 
reliability improvements to the Ethereum Virtual Machine.21 The complete development roadmap for 
both the Grothendieck Team and the ETCDEV Team can be found at: 
 
https://iohk.io/projects/ethereum-classic/#devupdates 
https://www.etcdevteam.com/roadmap.html 
 
The most important difference though, is that there is a clear appreciation by the Ethereum Classic 
developers that digital currencies are critical to the long-term sustainability of their associated 
blockchains. Further, they recognize that a digital token’s lasting value is justified by the trustless 
nature of its protocol. On the contrary, the Ethereum community’s philosophy centers on the idea 
that they will both build and break the technology to further their mission of accelerating the use of 
“decentralized” protocols and tools, without regard for the digital assets that underlie them. While it 
is a noble endeavor, we think this approach makes ETH less attractive from an investment 
perspective.  
 
It is our view that the market is underappreciating important differences in governance, economics, 
and development between these two protocols.  As long-term strategic investors in the digital 
currency ecosystem, we believe that the network effect can substantially shift from Ethereum to 
Ethereum Classic as more investors, miners, and developers fully appreciate these differences.  
 
 

The Investment Opportunity for ETC 
 
 
We’ve identified two possible drivers of alpha for Ethereum Classic and ETC. First, ETC possesses 
store-of-value properties similar to precious metals and bitcoin, giving it credence as an inflation 
hedge over long-term investment horizons. Second, as the digital token that runs Ethereum Classic 
smart contracts, ETC can become the scarce commodity that powers a universally-scalable Internet 
of Things. Throughout this section, we’ll outline the rationale supporting each of these fundamental 
drivers and evaluate the market opportunity across both dimensions.

A Digital Store-of-Value  
 
There are certain core properties that are essential to the investability of an asset as a store-of-value, 
be it physical or digital. Gold, silver, platinum, bitcoin and now ETC share the following characteristics 
that we believe are key to the success and sustainability of store-of-value assets: 
 

 Scarcity: ETC is a scarce asset. It is estimated that the supply will level off near 210 million 
tokens by the year 2070 with a capped maximum of 230 million tokens that can ever enter 
circulation. This is an explicit design element of the Ethereum Classic protocol.22 As of March 
2nd, 2017, there were approximately 89.3 million ETC floating in the market.23 
 

 Divisibility: Digital currencies represent some of the most divisible forms of payment 
available in the world. The smallest possible unit of ETC, a “wei,” represents 
0.000000000000000001 of a single token. ETC can be displayed out to eighteen decimal 
places, creating one quintillion units within each.  
 

 Portability: ETC can be sent across borders electronically and clear almost instantly, making 
it an alternative to bitcoin and far more portable than precious metals or fiat currency.  

 
 Fungibility: One unit of ETC represents the same exact value as another unit of equal size.  

 
 Verifiability: ETC are unique cryptographic tokens that are directly verifiable on the Ethereum 

Classic blockchain, in real-time, from anywhere in the world.  
 

 Recognizability: ETC is gaining broader recognition as a transactional token with perceived 
utility, with thousands of transactions now taking place on a daily basis.24 

 
Furthermore, the protocol underlying a digital currency must also possess additional properties to 
qualify its token as a store-of-value: 
 

 Decentralization: Ethereum Classic operates as a decentralized network. In principle, 
decentralized networks are more secure and stable than centralized or concentrated-control 
networks, since there is no single point of failure. Internet protocols like email and http are 
examples of widely-used decentralized networks.  
 

 Immutability: Ethereum Classic maintains an immutable global blockchain, preventing any 
possibility of fraud, censorship, or unjust interference by any actor. 

 
 Adaptability: The open-source nature of the Ethereum Classic protocol allows for continuous 

adaptation and improvement. Adaptability is essential to the future viability of any 
technology.

The Store-of-Value Market Opportunity for ETC 
 
While many investors already view bitcoin as digital gold, we view ETC as digital silver or platinum. 
Our rationale for this is twofold. First, in the same way that silver and platinum have store-of-value 
properties and general industrial application in the physical economy, we see ETC as an asset with 
store-of-value properties and broad industrial application in the digital economy. Second, just as 
investing in silver and platinum, in addition to gold, can diversify a precious metals allocation, we 
believe that investing in a select mix of digital currencies, including ETC, can produce similar benefits 
and increase risk-adjusted returns.  
 
As a result, we assess the investment opportunity for ETC as a store-of-value asset through a market 
share framework, based on observations of the precious metals market. According to BlackRock, as 
of December 30th, 2016 there was approximately $72 billion invested in physically-backed gold 
exchange-traded products (ETPs), $9 billion invested in silver ETPs, and $3 billion invested in other 
precious metal ETPs, a category largely comprised of platinum.25 By extrapolating from the share that 
various precious metals maintain in the physical store-of-value market, we imagine that ETC can 
capture a comparable portion of the digital store-of-value market. In the following chart, we look at 
how the price of ETC could change if its market capitalization relative to bitcoin were to grow to the 
same size as silver and platinum relative to gold.

If the market capitalization of ETC were to grow to the same relative size of platinum to gold (4%), a 
single token could be worth more than $9 – nearly 7X its March 2nd, 2017 market price. Moreover, if 
the market capitalization of ETC were to assume the same relative size of silver to gold (13%), a single 
token could be worth roughly $30 – more than 22X its March 2nd, 2017 market price.28 
 
The Commodity that Powers the Internet of Things (IoT) 
 
The Internet of Things is a concept used to describe an automated and interoperable, physical-digital 
world, in which every day items can be connected to the internet to share information and value with 
people and other devices. Simply put, the IoT translates into a more open, systematic, and efficient

There is tremendous investment opportunity in the IoT. McKinsey estimates the economic impact of 
a full-scale IoT to be between $4 trillion and $11 trillion per year by 2025.29 They identify nine different 
settings where IoT technologies can be implemented to capture this value:

Today, there are numerous IoT technologies in development or in use. Companies including Amazon, IBM, 
AT&T, Bosch, Cisco, Dell, GE, and Google are all researching, investing in, and building their own IoT 
hardware and software solutions. While applications that streamline the transmission and synthesis of data 
are beginning to emerge, there are considerable concerns about data security and privacy, network 
interoperability, and the lack of incentives driving adoption of these solutions. According to Cisco, 
approximately 99% of physical objects with IoT potential are still unconnected.31 We broadly attribute this 
to the absence of a common platform that resolves these issues. 
 
We believe Ethereum Classic provides the greatest opportunity to achieve a global IoT, as a scalable 
technology platform with superior features along each of these dimensions: 
 
Data Security & Privacy 
 
As a decentralized protocol with smart contracts, Ethereum Classic gives individuals and enterprises the 
ability to control, track, and monetize the distribution of proprietary data, intellectual property, and other 
digital content in a cryptographically secure environment. Furthermore, with an immutable global 
blockchain, Ethereum Classic is not subject to censorship, fraud, tampering, or unjustified interference by 
a central authority. Envision a world in which applications built on Ethereum Classic allow users to upload 
original music, photographs, writing or even personal medical records to an online portal. Using an 
intuitive smart contract interface, they could specify who can consume their content, how much it will 
cost, and how it can be redistributed, among other desirable parameters. This gives users an incredible 
new way to protect their digital content in the Internet Era.  
 
Interoperability 
 
Ethereum Classic offers universal interoperability for applications and business models built on its network 
via the integration of smart contracts. Smart contracts can autonomously transmit information and value 
from machine-to-person (M2P) and machine-to-machine (M2M) without the need for human intervention, 
connecting seemingly independent devices. Cisco estimates that the Machine-Payable Web will account 
for roughly two-thirds of the value associated with IoT.32 With this level of interoperability, we can imagine 
how Ethereum Classic could be used to optimize global supply chain logistics. Suppliers, manufacturers, 
wholesalers, and retailers could build fully interoperable M2M and M2P applications that streamline 
inventory management, transportation, distribution, accounting, and payment processes. 
 
Economic Incentives 
 
Ethereum Classic possesses a borderless digital token with store-of-value properties that can incentivize 
participation to organically grow the IoT. This virtuous cycle can function as follows:  
 

1) Speculative demand by investors over the economic potential that Ethereum Classic possesses 
can drive appreciation of ETC.  

2) Miners validate transactions and support the speed and security of the network, in order to earn 
freshly minted ETC. 

3) As the network becomes more secure, developers can build real-world applications on Ethereum 
Classic, attracted by a novel internet infrastructure that offers access to untapped revenue 
streams.

4) As new applications are developed on Ethereum Classic, consumer adoption can be driven 
by implicit incentives, via the realization of productivity gains, or explicit incentives, perhaps 
in the form of ETC rebates. 

 
By completing this cycle, ETC can transition from a digital currency whose value is driven by 
speculative demand to one whose value is driven by utilitarian demand.   
 
The IoT Market Opportunity for ETC 
 
We evaluate the investment opportunity for ETC, as a digital commodity powering IoT applications, 
using a working capital framework. According to IHS Markit, a leading source of research and 
analytics for the technology ecosystem, approximately 75.4 billion devices may be connected to the 
IoT by 2025.33 Assuming that some percentage of these devices run Machine-Payable Web operations 
using Ethereum Classic and that a certain amount of value, denominated in ETC, will need to be in 
the ‘pipes’ as the ‘fuel’ facilitating these transactions, we can begin to assess the asymmetric return 
potential of ETC.

For example in 2025, if 1% of IoT devices were to run on Ethereum Classic, each with an average daily 
transaction volume of $1, approximately $754 million worth of ETC could be needed as working 
capital on a daily basis. Conservatively, assuming that the market capitalization of ETC would need 
to be at least equivalent to the daily working capital requirement, the price of a single token of ETC 
could be worth roughly $5. Moreover, if 10% of IoT devices were to run on Ethereum Classic, each 
with an average daily transaction volume of $3, approximately $22.62 billion worth of ETC could be 
needed as working capital. In this scenario, the price of a single ETC token could approach $150.35 
 
By giving the IoT a common language to communicate in, a common currency to transact with, and 
an immutable global blockchain to store, track, and manage the flow of information and value, 
quickly, accurately, securely, and without the need for trusted intermediaries, Ethereum Classic can 
capture synergies across every setting and payment segment. 
 
 

ETC in Portfolio Construction 
 
 
As Ethereum Classic promotes economic growth in innovative ways, ETC gives investors an 
opportunity to build more efficient portfolios.  
 
Slow global growth, secularly high debt burdens, deteriorating effectiveness of monetary policies, 
and low yielding assets are all contributing to a savings crisis that threatens the economic welfare of 
future generations. We are entering a low return environment with significant downside risks, where 
it will be difficult for many investors to achieve their target returns. There are two options available 
to investors: 
 
 

1) Increase exposure to risky assets already held in their portfolios in hopes of generating higher 
returns. However, this will mean holding more concentrated, less diversified portfolios, with 
higher risk of ruin. 
 

2) Identify uncorrelated assets with positive expected returns, and use them to build more 
balanced portfolios. 

 
 
As a distinct, uncorrelated asset, ETC can broaden a digital currency allocation and further diversify 
investor portfolios to help them achieve their investment goals. Between July 23rd and March 2nd, 
2017, ETC had an average cross-sectional correlation of 0.1 with the following major asset classes 
and currencies. Notably, ETC was negatively correlated with bitcoin during the same period.

Correlation of ETC to Asset Classes & Currencies36 
Based on Rolling 10-Day Returns 

 
 

To gain a deeper understanding of the diversification benefits that ETC can offer, we ran a series of 
simulations on both digital currency and traditional investment portfolios.  
 
In the first example, we looked at how a digital currency portfolio consisting of 95% bitcoin and 5% 
ETC would have performed versus a portfolio solely comprised of bitcoin. We ran this simulation for 
the following reasons: 
 

 ETC shares common properties with investable digital currencies like bitcoin that 
fundamentally support its role as a store-of-value asset and inflation hedge over long-term 
investment horizons. 
 

 While both ETC and bitcoin are digital assets with store-of-value properties, each have 
unique, diversifying characteristics. For example, ETC could become the dominant digital 
currency for the Machine-Payable Web, while bitcoin will likely continue to be the dominant 
peer-to-peer digital currency. 

 
 It can provide insight as to whether a diversified investment in a basket of select digital 

currencies might deliver better risk-adjusted returns than a standalone investment in bitcoin. 
                                                            
36Source: Bloomberg, TradeBlock, Poloniex, Bitfinex. PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS. As the period during which ETC has 
been available has only been approximately six months, the correlations may not be meaningful when considering longer periods. Correlations are based on 10-day 
rolling returns from July 23, 2016 through March 2, 2017. Performance of bitcoin is based on the daily values of the Bloomberg Bitcoin/US Dollar Spot Price. Performance 
of ETC is based on the daily values provided by Poloniex from July 23 through July 26, Bitfinex from July 27 through December 13, and the TradeBlock ECX Index 
thereafter.

As the above figures show, the blended portfolio, containing bitcoin and ETC (blue), produced a 
hypothetical simulated cumulative return that was more than 8% higher than that of a pure bitcoin portfolio 
(red), with lower volatility.39 
 
In the second example, we looked at the incremental effects of adding a broader digital currency allocation 
(1-5%), comprised of bitcoin (90%) and ETC (10%), to a Global 60/40 portfolio. Since digital currencies 
provide exposure to market opportunities not captured by traditional asset classes, we were excited to 
quantify the potential benefits that they can offer.

Our analysis revealed that even small allocations to digital currency can significantly enhance the returns 
of traditional portfolios, while also reducing risk. 
 

 Adding a 1% digital currency allocation to the Global 60/40 increased the hypothetical simulated 
cumulative return by 78 bps, while also reducing volatility to improve risk-adjusted returns.42 

 
 Adding a 3% digital currency allocation to the Global 60/40 increased the hypothetical simulated 

cumulative return by 235 bps, while also reducing volatility to improve risk-adjusted returns.43 
 

 Adding a 5% digital currency allocation to the Global 60/40 increased the hypothetical simulated 
cumulative return by 394 bps, while also reducing volatility to improve risk-adjusted returns.44

It is important to highlight that adding a small allocation to ETC within the digital currency sleeve further 
enhanced the risk-adjusted returns of the Global 60/40 versus simulations only including bitcoin. We 
emphasize this point because the hypothetical simulated performance data supports our thesis that there 
are benefits that investors can realize by incorporating multiple investable digital currencies into the 
construction of their portfolios. It also reinforces that digital currency has grown to become a new asset 
class that encompasses more than just bitcoin. Even though our hypothetical simulated analysis is limited 
by the short timeframe over which Ethereum Classic and ETC have existed, our findings are consistent 
with the mathematical principle that uncorrelated assets with positive returns can improve the efficiency 
of investor portfolios.  
 
 

Conclusion 
 
 
We believe in a future of multiple digital currencies, in which unique comparative advantages allow each 
to play a distinct role in driving economic growth and in diversifying modern investment portfolios. Yet as 
new tokens enter the fold, it becomes more and more difficult to sift through the noise to identify truly 
revolutionary assets. Recognizing that this can be challenging for many investors, we have developed a 
framework to qualify digital currencies with long-term investability. Through this lens, we have come to 
believe that ETC marks the next generation in a class of investable digital assets, complementing bitcoin, 
and broadening a dynamic new asset class. With its store-of-value properties, abundant real-world 
applications, asymmetric return potential, and diversifying characteristics, ETC stands to radically improve 
many aspects of our lives while also providing investors with a new tool to build efficient portfolios. We 
look forward to learning more from our experience with this exciting new asset and will continue to deliver 
investment insights on the broader digital currency ecosystem.

IN ADDITION TO OTHER DIFFERENCES, PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD NOTE THE FOLLOWING POTENTIALLY 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ASSUMPTIONS MADE IN THE HYPOTHETICAL SIMULATED PERFORMANCE AND THE 
CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE ETCT WILL PERFORM, WHICH COULD CAUSE THE ACTUAL RETURN OF THE ETCT TO DIFFER 
CONSIDERABLY FROM RETURNS SET FORTH BY THE HYPOTHETICAL SIMULATED PERFORMANCE, TO BE MATERIALLY LOWER 
THAN THE RETURNS AND TO RESULT IN LOSSES OF SOME OR ALL OF THE INVESTMENT BY PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS:

PERFORMANCE WAS INTENDED TO SHOW HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE OF AN INVESTMENT IN ETC AND OTHER ASSETS.) 

THE GENERAL MARKET DATA USED IN THE HYPOTHETICAL SIMULATED PERFORMANCE DOES NOT REFLECT ACTUAL TRADING 
ACTIVITY AND COULD NOT BE REPLICATED BY THE ETCT IN ITS ACTUAL TRANSACTIONS. If actual trading activity was 
executed at levels that differed significantly from the general market data used in the hypothetical simulated performance, 
the actual returns achieved would have varied considerably from the results of the hypothetical simulated performance and 
could have been substantially lower and could result in significant losses. 

UNLIKE THE ETCT, THE HYPOTHETICAL SIMULATED PERFORMANCE DOES NOT ASSUME ANY GAINS OR LOSSES FROM 
TRADING AND THEREFORE DOES NOT REFLECT THE POTENTIAL LOSSES, COSTS AND RISKS POSED BY TRADING AND 
HOLDING ACTUAL ASSETS. 

The hypothetical simulated performance does not reflect the impact the market conditions may have had upon the ETCT were 
it in existence during the historical period selected. 

The hypothetical simulated performance does not reflect any fees incurred by the ETCT. If such amounts had been included 
in the hypothetical simulated performance, the results would have been lowered. 

AS A RESULT OF THESE AND OTHER DIFFERENCES, THE ACTUAL RETURN OF THE ETCT MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE 
RETURNS SET FORTH IN THE HYPOTHETICAL SIMULATED PERFORMANCE, WHICH IS HYPOTHETICAL AND MAY NEVER BE 
ACHIEVED. Reasons for a deviation may also include, but are by no means limited to, changes in regulatory and/or tax law, 
generally unfavorable market conditions and the Risk Factors set forth below. 
 
 
Certain Risk Factors 
 
Grayscale’s Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trust (ETCT) is a private, unregistered investment vehicle and not subject to the same 
regulatory requirements as exchange traded funds or mutual funds, including the requirement to provide certain periodic 
and standardized pricing and valuation information to investors. There are substantial risks in investing in Grayscale’s 
Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trust, including but not limited to:  
 
PRICE VOLATILITY  
ETC has historically experienced significant intraday and long-term price swings.  
 
MARKET ADOPTION  
It is possible that ETC will never be broadly adopted by either the retail or commercial marketplace, in which case, ETC may 
lose most, if not all, of its value.  
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION  
The regulatory framework of ETC remains unclear and application of existing regulations and/or future restrictions by federal 
and state authorities may have a significant impact on the value of ETC.  
 
SECURITY  
While the ETCT has implemented powerful security measures for the safe storage of ETC, there have been significant incidents 
of digital currency theft and ETC remains a potential target for hackers. ETC that are lost or stolen cannot be replaced, as 
transactions are irrevocable.

TAX TREATMENT OF VIRTUAL CURRENCY 
On March 25, 2014 the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released tax guidance applicable to digital and virtual currency stating 
“Under currently applicable law, virtual currency is not treated as currency that could generate foreign currency gain or loss 
for U.S. federal tax purposes. For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles 
applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.” However, this can potentially change in the 
future. 
 
TAX STRUCTURE OF THE TRUST 
The ETCT may involve a complex tax structure, which should be reviewed carefully, and may involve structures or strategies 
that may cause delays in important tax information being sent to investors. 
 
NO SHAREHOLDER CONTROL 
The sponsor has total authority over the ETCT and shareholders' rights are extremely limited. 
 
LACK OF LIQUIDITY AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS 
An investment in the ETCT will be illiquid and there will be significant restrictions on transferring interests in the ETCT. 
 
POTENTIAL RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY MANAGEMENT 
The ETCT and its managers or advisors may rely on the trading expertise and experience of third-party managers or advisors, 
the identity of which may not be fully disclosed to investors. 
 
FEES AND EXPENSES 
The ETCT's fees and expenses (which may be substantial regardless of any returns on investment) will offset the ETCT's trading 
profits. 
 
POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
The ETCT and its sponsor, managers, advisors and agents may be subject to various conflicts of interest. 
 
Additional General Disclosures 
 
Investors must have the financial ability, sophistication/experience and willingness to bear the risks of an investment. Please 
refer to the Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trust Private Placement Memorandum for a list of additional risk factors. 
 
In making an investment decision, investors must rely on their own examination of the ETCT and the terms of the offering 
contemplated by the Offering Documents, including the merits and risks involved. An investment in the ETCT is not suitable 
for all investors. The ETCT is a private investment vehicle and is NOT subject to the same regulatory requirements as SEC-
registered exchange traded funds or similar investment vehicles. The ETCT is not registered with the SEC and the ETCT’s 
shares are being offered in a private placement pursuant to Rule 506(c) under Regulation D.  As a result, the ETCT’s shares 
are restricted and subject to significant limitations on resales or transfer. Potential investors should carefully consider the 
long term nature of an investment in the ETCT prior to making an investment decision.
