Introduction

The total value of the global sports betting market is difficult 
to estimate because of lack of consistency in how it is 
regulated in some parts of the world. Sports betting makes 30 
to 40 percent of global gambling market. Size of one part of 
global gambling (online) is estimated as 37.9bn USD in 2017(1), 
and its constantly rising. There is also a trend inside global 
gambling that people are more and more moving from 
mainstream gambling (lotteries, casinos, poker and other 
gaming) to sports betting because of simple fact that there are 
more options and play look more fair.

In last few years, sports betting is developing in crypto space, 
and there are more and more sportsbook sites accepting BTC 
and other crypto currencies every month. In time this 
whitepaper is written there are more than 50 online 
sportsbooks accepting crypto.

The purpose of 1X2 Coin is to become one of crypto currencies 
accepted in crypto sportsbooks as payment option 
(deposit/withdraw), and that’s just 1st phase. We will affiliate 
all good sportsbooks in market and future plan is to develop 
our own crypto enabled sportsbook site which will enter strong 
in this multibillion market.

We will start as advanced Masternode coin with progressive 
reward scheme and very attractive ROI for our investors.

Masternodes

Constant growth and the innovation of our systems is a 

crucial objective for our strategy. Therefore, 1X2 is a self-

funded system that has its own dedicated masternodes, 

used as budget to maintains and improve the project.

Based on this model we have developed financial structure 

that would generate income for 1X2 Coin owners while 

utilizing 1X2 Coin itself for security of the blockchain. In 

masternodes networks users of the platform and owner of 

1X2 Coin are compensated by the network trough allocation 

of rewards based upon 1X2 Coin owner contributions to the 

network as confirmation nodes and masternodes.

1X2 Coin is distributed within a hybrid network for securing 

the blockchain by confirming transactions while ensuring 

the privacy of transactions and facilitating instant 

transaction with users of our platform. 1X2 Coin is not 

limited to securing the network, it can be used as 

instrument for payments.

The main goal of 1X2 Coin is to serve as the cryptocurrency 

that is used by our partners, worldwide sportsbooks which 

accepts cryptocurrency, for transfer of funds and payments 

within our platform.



Coinholders

Coinholder or Staker is an individual who owns some type 

of digital asset such as cryptocurrency and one individual 

can be a stakeholder of many different types of 

cryptocurrencies.  Most cryptocurrencies provide their own 

wallets via link on their websites. Coins can then be 

transferred from the exchange into the wallet for storage 

and distribution purposes.

A Coinholder or staker, collect passive rewards on any 

amount of 1X2 Coin in their wallet. When visiting any 

affiliate exchange users can purchase 1X2 Coins and 

purchased coins can be stored in their digital wallet 

secured by the password.  Here coins "stake" and verify 

other parties' transactions with purpose to earn more coins 

for the holder. By using our digital wallet users will be part 

of our exclusive coinholder network which is very user-

friendly, so users can complete transfer of fund in quick 

and easy manner. 

In first iteration of 1X2 Coin, coinholders collect all the 

benefits of 1X2 Coin's digital currency without ability to 

vote on the blockchain for the initiatives pursues.  



Proof of stake

In traditional blockchain technologies, such as Bitcoin, 

preliminary proof-of-work concept was an energy-intensive 

blockchain technology based on the hashing protocol where 

miners are used to verify transaction on the network. This 

concept used substantial amount of energy, computation 

power and time needed to mine the coin. In this concept 

there is clear distinction between stakeholders and miners. 

Stakeholders are individuals who use network to facilitate a 

transaction. For example, if someone sends to someone 

one Bitcoin on the network, the block transaction is then 

verified by third party miners. Miners produce a 

mathematical computation based on the difficulty set by 

the network's parameter. The first miner to solve 

mathematical equation is rewarded and this is announced 

on the network before the block is created to be solved.

Proof-of-stake algorithm is based on storage of all the 

operations in the 1X2 Coin wallet with the distributed 

database.  This system is based on the principles of 

decentralized management in the absence of single 

controlling authority. Synchronization of 1X2 Coin nodes 

which is running on proof-of-stake is done through the 

peer-to-peer network, P2P. Proof-of-stake is more efficient 

and environmental friendlier than proof-of-work, which 

utilizes lots of energy by using specific integrated circuit 

(ASIC) machines. This method can be use without expensive 

mining equipment on a normal entry level computer.  1X2 

Coin user-friendly proof-of-stake removes the need for 

miners altogether. With proof-of-stake users earn rewards 

on the coins held in their wallet by following few simple 

steps:

1. Download the 1X2 Coin wallet from website

2. Purchase 1X2 Coin from an affiliate exchange

3. Place coins in digital wallet

4. Coin earn rewards through being staked as collateral to 

verify transactions on the blockchain

Pre-mine and project funding

The pre-mine of 1X2 Coin is 180000 coins, 

0,85% of total supply and one of smallest in industry.

From those, 60000 coins (33.33%) will be offered to public 

presale. If any coin from presale is not sold, we will burn 

them 24h after presale and that will be announced 

properly. Funds from coin sale will be used for listing on 

initial 5 exchanges, listing on MN portals, bounties, paid 

news articles, YouTube channels, google ads and all sort of 

marketing activities during 12-month period until our own 

sportsbook is launched.
