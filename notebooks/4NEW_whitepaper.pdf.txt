Ladies and Gentlemen,

The team at 4NEW is proud to announce the world's first ever coin that embodies electricity. 

Our product is grounded in necessities, solving two global & social problems; waste surplus and 

energy shortfall.   

Our blockchain platform will be built on top of the underlying waste treatment infrastructure 

covering the entire supply chain from collection of waste to generation of electricity to 

application of it within the cryptocurrency transactions processing.  

Given the utilitarian nature of our services, it is our belief that 4NEW will successfully integrate 

the blockchain network within the real world applications of energy consumption by the crypto 

community leading to widespread mainstream adoption.  

Our seasoned management team, with over 300 years of collective experience, brings a vast 

and diverse perspective that has enabled 4NEW to explore rare and unique opportunities. We 

are excited to present a solution such as ours that will revolutionize and standardize four 

industries, Crypto-mining, blockchains, Waste Management and Energy, creating disruptive

economies of scale on a global level.

PROBLEM

 

Cryptocurrencies global market capitalization has surpassed $500 billion USD rising over 

2000% in 2017.  This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future as businesses 

increasingly embrace the elegant design and transparency the blockchain offers to all.  

However, as of December 2017, Bitcoin mining energy intake has officially surpassed the entire 

energy consumption of Denmark.  As the difficulty of mining increases to reflect the influx of 

miners joining the network, this energy consumption will increase.   

The most astounding aspect of this is that the rate of expansion is exponential. At the current 

rate of consumption, next year Bitcoin mining will consume enough energy to be listed as the 

twentieth country in the world by energy consumption. The model is simply unsustainable. The 

world relies primarily on the production of energy from the burning of coal and oil, which not only 

damages the environment, but the economy as a whole. If Bitcoin has a great enough impact on 

 kilowatt will rise globally.   

The more valuable one bitcoin becomes, the more energy will be used to mine that coin, 

therefore with price spikes, come energy spikes. This will go on until energy around the world 

will cost much more than it does currently, as a result of increased demand from miners 

globally.

4NEW SOLUTION

4NEW is the world's first eco-friendly, tangible, waste to energy blockchain solution. The 

concept is quite simple, the process of refining waste product into water and organic materials 

creates energy and that is then leveraged to either be sold to the national grid or applied to 

operate mining processes at its onsite mining farm. 

The cost to produce the energy is met through the revenue generated from the waste collection 

services and sale of byproducts facilitating a sustainable operation at breakeven or a marginal 

profit. Therefore, the energy produced is unencumbered and freely available for utilization 

orsale to the national grid. 

Historically, the price of 1 kilowatt has been very stable for the past fifty years at approximately 

$0.15 globally, inflation adjusted. This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future in 

lieu of technological innovations. However, the wild card that no one has truly evaluated is the 

exponential acceptance of the blockchain worldwide leading to a massive spike in energy 

consumption by cryptocurrency mining that could drive the price of energy up globally. 4NEW 

has the unique opportunity to apply this finite lifetime supply of energy to its coin, namely, 

KWATT. The 4NEW coin symbol is KWATT2. Each KWATT Coin embodies within it, 1 kilowatt 

of electricity for a year. 

 

NOTE2 - KWATT Coin was formerly named FRNCoin. It is the same coin, just a different coin 
symbol.

4NEW is a producer of energy. Consequently, 4NEW enjoys a unique vantage point to apply its 

energy at a fixed price, inflation adjusted for a significant period of time. This will enable 

standardization of transaction fees within the crypto community. 

This standardization of fees cannot be matched by any other blockchain as they have to 

purchase their energy from retailers. 

Our blockchain will enable payment system platform that can accommodate all utilization of the 

KWATT Coin in varied and diverse industries. 

The 4NEW decentralized, distributed ledger is where all actors in any industry will be able to 

transact using the KWATT coin. The coins are smart contracts which establish a binding 

relationship between transacting parties and provide a value for each transaction. 

The ledger will provide an immutable and audit-able journal of all transactions related to 

purchase and sale of goods and services on the blockchain. With all parties to each transaction 

being able to see the same ledger entry, costs of reconciliation and potential issue of disputes 

and revenue leakage are controlled to a very large extent. This will standardize three industries 

of Waste, Energy and cryptocurrencies that are yearning for technological innovation. This will 

also enable KWATT.

to select the mining farm then the energy will be applied to the mining farm.

The KWATT Coin will represent a certain hashing capacity per coin. This concept is not new; 

Companies such as Giga Watt have offered similar mining items for lower costs, however, 

KWATT Coin is extremely unique in scope. We do not charge energy fees for mining, the only 

cost to a coin holder is the cost of the coin. This means that a coin holder will be able to mine all 

cryptocurrencies for the lifetime without spending an additional penny for their energy bill. The 

energy is free to us, so it is free also to the coin holders.  

How does 4NEW Sustain Itself?  

The concept of 4NEW relies upon the waste to energy model. In this model we are paid for the 

waste that we process, and the sale of byproducts such as fertilizer, organic materials and clean 

water. The start up costs to this mechanism are funded by 

overhead is funded by cash flow generated from collection of waste and revenue from sale of 

byproducts. Additionally, 4NEW, and the 4NEW team will retain a portion of the KWATT Coins 

(and their associated mining capacity) which will provide an additional revenue stream moving 

forward. 

The Mining Capacity of a KWATT Coin 

The most difficult part of the KWATT Coin design has been determining a model to correlate 

with the increase in mining difficulty. We understand that one hash today can represent half of 

its mining power a month from now. To solve this issue, we have decided to have the coin 

represent a fraction of the total mining capacity of the 4NEW network rather than a fixed 

mathematical rate. This concept allows 4NEW to expand their mining capacity to match a 

competitive rate on the network. This rate of exponential expansion will be a predetermined 

rein ining portfolio, in addition to 

the profits from the other revenue streams. This model not only guarantees the longevity of free 

energy, but the longevity of competitive mining practices.

Portfolio Customization 

Users will have the ability to decide which coins or coins they would like to put their KWATT 

Coin power towards to mine. The options will consist of the top twenty minable coins, this 

decision will automatically point the necessary amount of hash rate towards mining that coin, 

and the yield will be transacted to the account associated with your 4NEW Wallet. 

Proof-of-Work / Proof-of-Stake 

In recent months, Ethereum has taken steps towards a Proof of Stake system that will be fully 

implemented sometime in the following years. At 4NEW we fully support these steps and 

understand that more efficient systems are necessary for the sustainability of cryptocurrency in 

the long term. Yet, we also understand that Proof of Work will not likely be fully removed from 

cryptocurrency within the next decade. For this reason, additional precautionary steps must be 

taken to reduce the economic and environmental effects of the inefficiencies associated with 

Proof-of-Work mining, and our mission is to be on the vanguard of these efforts. Even if Proof of 

Work was completely removed and Bitcoin mining non-existent, the energy embodied within the 

coin can still be either applied to the Proof of Stake mining operations or the national grid, given 

severe energy shortfalls already prevalent within the world. 

Management and KWATT Coin Holder Interests aligned 

Given that the Waste to Energy plant will sustain its operations at breakeven from revenue 

generated from the sale of waste collection services and byproducts, the energy produced is 

free. This lifetime supply of free energy is being purchased by the coin holder in this crowdsale. 

Any revenue generated from the administrative and facilitation fees the company will charge to 

either sell the energy to the national grid or apply it to the crypto-mining farm on behalf of the 

coin holders will allow for future growth and expansion strategy. Therefore, increasing the 

overall demand for the coin. With three plants, the total output capacity rises to roughly 1 billion 

kilowatts per annum. This will enable a market capitalization of the coin to rival most successful 

cryptocurrencies.

Please note, the utilization of the KWATT Coin referenced below is in addition to the energy 
applications of the coin within the waste to energy and the crypto mining industry. 

Our blockchain will be under development starting 2018 as per our roadmap. 4NEW has 
received significant interest from other institutions in diverse industries to integrate the KWATT 
Coins within their services. 

Upon attaining critical mass with Business to Business adoption, KWATT is positioned to be the 
next Bitcoin. Starting 2018, KWATT Coin holders will be able to use their coins for the following 
services as a payment tender for respective services. Beta testing will initiate in 2018 for the 
following businesses: 

-  WTE plant. The KWATT Coin will 
interact with the miners to enable them access to the blockchain in order to mine currencies of 
their choosing. 

- Two licensed operating global money transfer companies with a 
collective monthly money transfer turnover of over $25 Million USD in 15 year track record. This 
coin utility will enable KWATT to operate as a store of value allowing individuals to transfer 
funds globally using the KWATT Coin as a vessel. 

- A licensed pharmacy with over USD $24 Million in sales in the United 
States and 18 year track record. Upon completion of beta testing in March, individuals globally 
will be able to purchase their medications using the KWATT Coin from a fully licensed pharmacy 
online. 

- In 2018 we will initiate beta testing of the utilization of the KWATT Coin 
as a payment system for a 1.5 billion dollar healthcare insurance company with over 8 year 
track record. With over 90,000 members covered under their policies, anticipation is that the 
KWATT Coin will break critical mass and enter main stream utilization. 

 

4NEW Management will continue to work with operators in various industries to facilitate 
widespread adoption and utilization of its coin through 2018.

THE KWATT COIN PRICING
 

Each KWATT Coin is equal to 1kW of electricity. 

Global average retail price per kW of electricity is $0.15. 

Global average wholesale price per kW of electricity is $0.05. 

4NEW mining operation will pay $0.20 per kW. Therefore, each coin represents an intrinsic 

value of $0.20 per 1 kW of electricity. 

All energy generated by the plant will be owned by the KWATT Coin holders. 

KWATT Coin holder can either sell this power to the UK nati

mining farm. 

Net revenues, after administrative and facilitation fees, generated from the sale of the energy to 

the crypto mining farm will be distributed to the coin holder annually in cryptocurrencies. 

Net revenues, after administrative and facilitation fees, generated from the sale of the energy to 

the UK national grid will be retained for future plant build out leading to additional KWATT Coins 

being delivered to the coin holder. 

Revenue distribution will initiate 24 months after the completion of the Initial Coin Offering. The 

first 12 months will be plant buildout period and the second 12 months will be reserve build up 

period. Distribution will be annually thereafter.

MINING CASE STUDY3

BITMAIN CASE STUDY 

The energy efficiency of Bitcoin mining is significantly worse than initially anticipated, and the 
associated carbon footprint is worrisome. One test case of cryptocurrency mining is Bitmain. 

n buildings onsite that contain 
21,000 ASIC Bitcoin rigs, and one building contains 4,000 Litecoin rigs all producing around 
$200,000 profit daily after paying for 40MW of five cents per kilowatt-hour coal-powered 
electricity at around $40,000, and 50 salaried employees. 

One of the biggest liabilities of such a large mining operation is heat. As the temperature outside 
rises, the 5,000 BTU per hour producing mine begins to malfunction at a much higher frequency 
than typical. To counteract this heat, the hot air is pumped from the facility and the machines 
themselves are cooled with evaporative coolers. These systems collectively consume 

about one fifth of the to total power consumption of the mining facility. 

The total footprint of the mine is estimated to be around 24-40 tons of CO2 per hour. Assuming 
an identical energy efficiency, which is quite generous, this mean the total energy consumption 
of the Bitcoin network processes about 200 tons of CO2 per hour. However, this footprint could 
be significantly reduced if the source of energy is substituted for a greener method. 

This mining farm commands approximately 5% of the global bitcoin mining market share.
